The #nexus pen finally arrived today. Initial thoughts. 
1. The pen is much larger than I thought it was going to be
2. The packaging is pretty well put together.
3. The Bock nib is massive. Unfortunately doesn't indicate what type of nib it is either. 
4. Having a Schmidt converter and Bock nib is great but would have been nicer if they had Nexus specific logos. Slightly diminishes the professional view of the product. 
5. Matt coating is excellent.
