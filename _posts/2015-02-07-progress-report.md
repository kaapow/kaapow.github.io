<p>Itâ€™s been a while since I checked in on progress for <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a> Season 2. My <em>original</em> deadline for this season has shifted somewhat, but my plan was somewhat flawed in that I thought I could finish off the art the same year that  Zane (my son) was born - I am that <em>hopelessly</em> optimistic. That was never going to really happen. 
The good news is that I made incredible progress while I was on holiday and thankfully I am still riding that momentum. When I left in  December I had 6 strips fully completed. Now a little over a month later I have over 20 strips that are in varying degrees of completness. In addition to that I was able to work through the thumbnails for the remaining 10 strips. That&rsquo;s right, unlike the first season (which was 20 strips in total),  Season 2 will be expanded to 30 strips.</p>

<h3>Frictionless Creation</h3>

<p>I attribute the fact that I&rsquo;ve been able to create <em>anything</em> at all to the fact that I&rsquo;ve made a concerted effort in trying to remove as much friction in the creation process as possible.</p>

<ol><li>Make sure that each script has the thumbnails worked out for the entire page. Doodle, change the script if necessary.</li>
<li>Do all the lettering. I use <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch">Sketch</a> for this as it&rsquo;s my Freehand alternative. This gives me the word placement so that I can taylor the art accordingly (make sure the character&rsquo;s head isn&rsquo;t covered by a balloon).</li>
<li>As I&rsquo;m drawing all the artwork on A3 board, I need to cut them down the middle. I then also drew all the panels in, so that I have one less excuse to actually getting started on the art (ie doing something without actually doing anything).</li>
</ol><h3>Hopes &amp; Aspirations</h3>

<p>One of my desires for this strip, is that as I continue to draw it in the future, I&rsquo;ll always be able to look back and see a progression from the previous year. It means that I&rsquo;m trying to make the strip better and make myself better at the creation process. What I didn&rsquo;t anticipate was seeing a fluidity in the characters between the very first strip I drew and the recent strips.</p>

<p>This poses the question of whether I should go back and rework the original drawings to meet that fluidity or leave them as they currently are as a marker. My initial reaction is to leave them as they are. This is an ongoing strip, rather than a finite graphic novel. Things don&rsquo;t actually have to look consistent (nor do they, when you compare the very first season even).</p>

<h3>Deadlines</h3>

<p>I know I shouldn&rsquo;t really tempt fate and declare a deadline, but I want to be able to start publishing the newest season in the spring some time and feel that this goal is completely within my reach. The next massive hurdle that I have to start considering is how I promote the hell out of this series once I&rsquo;m finally ready to actually publish. More on that in future posts.</p>
