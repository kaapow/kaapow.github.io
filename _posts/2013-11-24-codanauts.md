In early 2012 I was working on an app for iOS with my cousin. The second company name we came up with was Codanauts. I loved the name and came up with this logo over a weekend. 2 months later my cousin found out about <a href="http://www.codenauts.com">Codenauts</a>. There is a subtle difference if you missed it: Cod-a-nauts vs Cod-e-nauts.

Oddly enough they seem to have stopped their operation and our operation never took off. I still love the similicity of this logo and hope to use it in the future.
