<strong>Hobonichi Planner</strong>

I didn’t even know that this was a thing until recently. It’s not only a thing, but it’s a beautiful thing. I’m still deciding what cover I should be going for but I definitely know how this little planner will work in my daily routine which has been missing something like this for a while.

These go on sale on the <a href="http://www.1101.com/store/techo/2015/planner/">1st of September</a>.
