<p>Without a doubt my single most favourite piece of technology of the last 10 years has been my original iPhone 4. It&rsquo;s lived by my side, every day for 4 years straight and been with me as I&rsquo;ve transitions from bacholor, to husband, to father. I created <a href="http://moonracket.com">Corgan and Alfie</a> on there as well.  It&rsquo;s travelled with me to Lebanon, England, Malaysia, Qatar and Greece.</p>

<p>However these last 6 months have been pretty rough. My home button stopped functioning very well (<em>sporadically at best</em>) and as was going to happen eventually, the apps became more optomised for newer hardware which effectively slowed them down on the older hardware.</p>

<p>Having said all that I still use the phone very single day for the following tasks:</p>

<ul><li>Alarm Clock</li>
<li>Podcasts (using <a href="https://overcast.fm">Overcast</a>) every morning before heading off to work. My phone connects to my car via bluetooth <em>of course</em></li>
<li><a href="http://reederapp.com">Reeder</a> for when I&rsquo;m waiting for something</li>
<li>Whatstapp and Messages</li>
<li>Receiving and making phonecalls (I know <strong>shocker</strong>), both the stock app and on Viber and Skype</li>
<li>Safari</li>
<li>Checking my emails (currently using mail.app)</li>
<li>Checking photos of the boy</li>
<li><a href="http://parents2parentsapps.com/soundsleeper/">Sound Sleeper</a> to put the boy to bed</li>
<li>And I&rsquo;ll even throw in a game or 3 (rediscovering the classic <a href="http://www.hexage.net/radiant/">Radiant</a> recently)</li>
</ul><p>Not bad for a 4 year old phone. However sometime after the <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/08/28/apple-announces-special-event-for-sept-9/">9th of September</a> that&rsquo;s going to change, following the release of the new iPhone. It honestly could not have come sooner.</p>

<p>The truth is, that while I&rsquo;m still using my phone consistently every day, I&rsquo;ve stopped enjoying using it and one fundamental aspect I have stopped using entirely, that of taking photos.  4 years on, it&rsquo;s really showing it&rsquo;s age in this respect. The camera interface takes a good long time to load and even when it does the pictures are just not that great when compared to my wife&rsquo;s iPhone 5c and certainly not my Sony NEX-F3.</p>

<p>So while the phone has served me incredibly well and for a great long period of time (more than any phone I have ever owned), it&rsquo;s time to say it&rsquo;s swang song and be relegated for the newest and greatest from the minds of Jony Ive and the fine folks a Apple.</p>
