It does feel refreshing to be back online and actually enjoying the process. I'm enjoying writing on a regular basis. I'm enjoying the conversations I'm having online, as people share links and thoughts that I might not have considered or known about.

The downside to this interaction is that my internet lizard brain has certainly kicked in full gear. What happens to me is that I end up going down rabbit holes and tweaking my site over and over again.  I end up wasting an inordinate amount of time. 

The saving grace for [Micro.blog](http://micro.blog) is the fact that I can't tinker with the HTML and once I finally settle on the aesthetics of the site, I can revert to concentrating on more important aspects.

To try and combat this, I'm going to set aside no more than 30 minutes a day in the pursuit of these frivolous but fun moments. My capping that time, I'll then be able to focus my attention on things that actually move me forward.
