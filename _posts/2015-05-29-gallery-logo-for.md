Logo for a mystery project I’ve been working on for several months now. It’s early days still, but wanted to share the <em>process</em> I go through for creating a logo. Started off in a <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com">Fieldnote</a> (<a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/colors/tworivers/">Two Rivers edition</a> if you have to ask), then moved it over to a Muji A5 notebook and then into <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a>.

Partially inspired by <a href="https://vimeo.com/113751583">this video</a> of Mr.Draplin - although our A’s go in different directions.
