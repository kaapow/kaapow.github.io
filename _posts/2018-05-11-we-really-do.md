We really do live in a world with a cornucopia of excellent text editors available on the Mac. My favourite editors are:

1. [The Archive](https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/) - for short snippets of text.
2. [iA Writer 4](https://ia.net/writer) - for most written projects
3. [Highland 2](https://quoteunquoteapps.com/highland-2/) - for scripts
4. [Coda 2](https://panic.com/coda/) - for coding
