Not sure how the idea came about, but this is effectively Alfie’s first appearance.

I needed a colour that would <em>pop</em> against the grey backgrounds that I was using. I also remember that after I drew him I realised that the little guy was an organic being and so would need an air bubble to breathe through while on the moon…please don’t argue with my logic, it’s <strong>fragile</strong>.

This is also the only time that Alfie would be drawn this small. All subsequent drawings have him coming to Corgan’s shoulder.
