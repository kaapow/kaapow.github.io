I have a **ton** of books to get through this summer. One that has catapulted up the list is Ben Rhodeâ€™s [The World As It Is]([www.amazon.co.uk/World-As-...](https://www.amazon.co.uk/World-As-Inside-Obama-White-ebook/dp/B079M3BQD8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1529511474&sr=8-1&keywords=the) world as it is). As a bonus check out his interview on [Pod Save the World](https://crooked.com/podcast/obamas-legacy-after-trump/).
