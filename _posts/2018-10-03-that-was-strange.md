That was strange. For a small window this afternoon, there were two copies of the [Hobonichi Weeks Mega Sneaker edition](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2019/pc/detail_cover/wb19_m_sneakerblue.html) available on the site (it's been sold out days after it was released). Guess a situation of being in the right place at the right time.
