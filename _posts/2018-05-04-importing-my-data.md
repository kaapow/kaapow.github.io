Importing my data from the various edges of the internet continues. Tumblr fell pretty quickly,  Medium is _half_ way there and now [Instagram](https://www.manton.org/2018/05/instagram-import-in-micro-blog.html). My Twitter account is going to require some work, as are my historic .md files (from my older blogs). Having everything under one roof however, is **amazing**, highly recommend it.
