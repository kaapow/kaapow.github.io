<p>For years I&rsquo;ve been exceptionally content with my choice of pen, the Muji 0.38mm gel ink pen, in <strong>black</strong>. The main issue with the pen was the cheap plastic enclosure that held that wonderful refill. I grew exceptionally bored of it and I was willing to splurge some money on something that was better.</p>

<p>Previously I&rsquo;d splash money on stationary related to my artwork, but never for my work related stationary. My hunt for a better enclosure made me look at all of my stationary in a decidedly different way and led me down a rabbit hole that I am yet to emerge from (listened to all the episodes of the <a href="http://www.relay.fm/penaddict">Pen Addict podcast</a>). Thankfully the situation is a lot more under control than when I first started on this journey. After a year of buying a wide range of pens, I now know pretty much what will appeal to me and will fit into my rotation pretty much instantly.</p>

<p>I intend to go into a decent amount of detail but rather than writing everything in one single shot, I&rsquo;ll highlight the main takes for now:</p>

<ol><li>I&rsquo;m likely not going to be expanding my fountain pen collection past a <a href="http://www.pelikan.com/pulse/Pulsar/en_US_INTL.FWI.displayShop.106959./classic-205-black-silver">Pelikan M205</a> in the future. It stops here at my <a href="http://www.sailorpen.com/professional-gear.html">Sailor Pro Gear Slim</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.midori-japan.co.jp/md/en/products/notebook.html">Midori MDs</a> are the only choice of sketch notebooks that I will likely ever use. These are perfect. The A4 version is next on my list.</li>
<li>Nothing beats my <a href="http://www.muji.eu/pages/online.asp?Sec=13&amp;Sub=52">Muji 0.38mm pen</a> for quick sketching and inking - the <em>Pilot Juice</em> pens come in a close second. I&rsquo;ve still to find my ideal holder - the original Takumi pen was a massive disappointment, hopefully version 2 goes in a better direction. Might have to design one myself.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve enjoyed using my <a href="http://www.1101.com/store/techo/2016/planner/index.html">Hobonichi Techo</a> (although not as often as I would want to and not with the type of content I was hoping for) - will be trying out an A5 version this year., maybe that format suits me better?</li>
<li>I will be getting a Nanami <a href="http://www.nanamipaper.com/products/copy-of-seven-seas-standard-a5-blank-journal.html">Seven Seas Standard</a> notebook in the future as well.</li>
<li>The Penxo is one of the best conceived and delivered Kickstarters that I&rsquo;ve ever used - even though they fucked up my order and gave me the wrong leads.</li>
<li>I will be getting a <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/colors/">Field Notes</a> subscription in November. I like the fun of seeing what these guys come up with and have been enjoying collecting these notebooks.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve still not found my ideal EDC pen. I still have time to back the <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/buy/karas-kustoms-edk">EDK</a>, but not sure if that&rsquo;s the one for me.</li>
</ol>
