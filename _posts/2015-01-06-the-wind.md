<p>The wind outside is <strong>howling</strong>. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s 4am in the morning and I can&rsquo;t sleep. Having a new baby will destroy this fragile thing called sleep. It doesn&rsquo;t exist for me in the way it did a year ago - maybe it was longer than that, I can&rsquo;t remember.</p>

<p>The house is creaking with every movement of the wind. </p>

<p>Of course it&rsquo;s the hour of the <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour_of_the_wolf">wolf</a>. I&rsquo;m still amazed on how little sleep one can <em>function</em> on. </p>

<p>The windows rattle with every major gust that blows.</p>

<p>At this time of the night, when everyone else is asleep your mind wanders to nothing in particular and crazy details that will be completely forgotten in the harsh light of the new day. You&rsquo;re alone with your thoughts and they mean nothing because they are not letting you find your sleep. </p>

<p>The wind outside will not relent. If you listen carefully, you hear the city bend to it&rsquo;s will. Metal against concrete, the screech of a cat, a car alarm (idiots still use those?).</p>
