<p>I’ve decided to use <a href="http://www.medium.com/@moonracket">Medium</a> as an additional platform from which I publish the new season of my comic, <em>Moon Racket!</em> Multiple factors coalesced to make this decision.</p>

<p>In the past I have used 3 different platforms to publish and distribute my comic strip:</p>

<ol><li>The official <a href="http://moonracket.com">website</a>, hosted on Tumblr</li>
<li>The <a href="http://tinyletter.com/moonracket">newsletter</a>, powered by Tinyletter</li>
<li>Tapastic (at least in the first season).</li>
</ol><p>Moving forward I’ll be publishing on Medium, <em>Moon Racket!</em> and through the newsletter. So what brought about this change? To answer that question, I think I should answer another question, how have the other platforms been faring?</p>

<p>The truth is that each of the above platforms provided very specific (detrimental) restrictions on the artwork itself, but also allowed for a potentially wider distribution. The problem is that this wider distribution never manifested itself in a meaningful way.</p>

<h3>Tumblr</h3>

<p>Moon Racket! is hosted on Tumblr, a platform usually suited for rectangular posts that fit within the stream that is present for eveyone. The restrictions on images are therefore made to suit their platform. The maximum size of image that can be posted is one that is 1200px wide. On a retina screen that’s the equivalent of a 600px image. The effect of this restriction is that my comic always appears blurry.</p>

<p>While this is a nitpick, for a perfectionist like myself, it’s a deal breaker.</p>

<h3>Newsletter</h3>

<p>If I thought that Tumblr provided restrictions, then I was in for a rude awakening with my newsletter experience. This one can only be typically shown in a 600px wide image, otherwise it will break most inboxes.</p>

<p>My experience with Tinyletter has been mixed. But ultimately my question for a beautiful experience was wrecked by that platform’s constraints. In mitigate I’ve moved things over to Mailchimp, which I’m hoping will offer better options and experience.</p>

<p>Even then, I’m still not showcasing the art in the best possible way.</p>

<h3>Tapastic</h3>

<p>This platform holds promise, but once again there are size restrictions to the images that can be uploaded. While the platform as a whole does allow for a plethora of things aimed at comic content creators, I don’t believe that I would be able to reap many (any?) of those benefits.</p>

<p>It’s also being lost in the sea that is being published there. Some of which is aimed at a very different audience.</p>

<hr /><p>Which brings me to Medium.</p>

<p>The editor provided on Medium is without question the best editor on the internet, have tried a very large number of them.</p>

<p>The other instant win for Medium is how the platform chooses to deal with images. They’re not just first class citizens, they are allowed to exist in a manner that makes them shine. In fact the more I write about this, the more convinced I am of what an idiot I am for not considering this platform earlier.</p>

<p>The biggest question I have is whether I can connect with an audience for an all ages comic strip about a robot (Corgan) and his worm friend (Alfie) that live on the moon, that’s made of cheese on Medium.</p>

<p>That’s a journey I’m happy to take, because if nothing else I’ll take it in <strong>style</strong>.</p>
