Traditionally I’ve been a <strong>huge</strong> tinkerer of my websites. Thankfully I turned a leaf last year and decided on a structure and function for each site and only allowed time for enhancing or correcting initial laziness.

For my personal musing site, I recently updated the CSS code to benefit from some of the theme editing functions that Tumblr provides. The whole design of <a href="http://www.aboualfa.tumblr.com">KAA</a> was intentionally completely text based to allow me to have infinite colour combinations.

As a fun experiment, I’ve been taking screenshots of the various colour schemes that I come up with.

Of course, the fact that I’ve not actually written anything meaningful on there for 5 months begs the question of why the design is even relevant, I’m just glad it’s there for when I <strong>eventually</strong> pull my finger out.
