<p>When I moved to the Middle East at the start of 2010 I used to listen to podcasts usually in the comfort of my home and from my computer. This meant that I actually consumed the programmes sporadically <em>at best</em> and wasn’t a particular follower of any except the odd comic book related podcast.</p>

<p>Sometime around 2011 all of that changed when I got my first (and so far only) iPhone. It’s getting <em>seriously</em> long in the tooth and will be getting an upgrade pretty soon but one of my primary uses on a daily basis is downloading and listening to podcasts.</p>

<p>Two things have come together that have really made the process seamless for me. Background downloads and bluetooth integration with my car.</p>

<p>The last part which is possibly the most important part to come together is the general high quality, diversity and format that many of these podcasts have adopted. Here is my Top 10 current favourites (in actual order of preference):</p>
