This weekend's mini project was making an [adjustable snake knot camera strap](https://www.lomography.com/magazine/336973-lomography-tutorials-adjustable-snake-knot-camera-strap). Went for some funky colours as the paracord on offer had limited colours available. If you have to go bold, go all the way.
