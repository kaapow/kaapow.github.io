⌚ The [latest iteration](https://www.mondaine.com/watches/mondaine-helvetica/helvetica-1-smartwatch.html) of Mondaine’s _smart_ watch concept is a solid design iteration on the previous model (the dial at the bottom always looked cramped). Definitely goes onto the same wantlist as the [Erik Spiekermann](https://www.mondaine.com/watches/mondaine-helvetica/helvetica-spiekermann-edition.html) editions I have coveted for a while.
