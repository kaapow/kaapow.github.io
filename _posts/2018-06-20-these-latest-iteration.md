⌚ These [latest iteration](https://www.mondaine.com/watches/mondaine-helvetica/helvetica-1-smartwatch.html) of Mondaine’s _smart_ watch is a solid design iteration on the previous model (the dial at the bottom looked cramped) - although not sure how the mechanism works now. I have been coveting one of the [Erik Spiekermann](https://www.mondaine.com/watches/mondaine-helvetica/helvetica-spiekermann-edition.html) editions for nearly a year now.
