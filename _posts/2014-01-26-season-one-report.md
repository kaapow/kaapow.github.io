<p>Today marks 20 consecutive weeks that I&rsquo;ve published a new episode for my online comic <a href="http://moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a>, so I thought it would be nice to take stock and review the experience.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/ae9a7dd334.jpg" alt="" /><strong>All 20 strips in a nice overview image.</strong></p>

<p>Rather than being completely harsh (which would come easily for me when reviewing my own work), I think I&rsquo;ll first highlight some of the things that I thought went well.</p>

<p>Firstly, the strip never missed a ship date. All 20 episodes were released every Sunday for 20 weeks. Secondly, the general reaction on both <a href="http://facebook.com/moonracket">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://moonracket.com">Tumblr</a> have been really great and I&rsquo;m grateful to everyone who has liked, shared or read the strip. I&rsquo;m still debating whether or not <a href="http://tapastic.com/series/moonracket">Tapastic</a> is worth it, but I do it for the 3 that have subscribed and hopefully enjoying the strip.</p>

<p>Overall, I give the strips an overall <strong>5/10</strong>. There are some stories that I think worked out better than others but the truth is I could have written better stories and could have developed the characters better.</p>

<p>One aspect that I am genuinely happy with is the <em>evolution</em> of the artwork. I still think it&rsquo;s ok and only the errors jump out at me, but at least I can see a proper improvement over the life of the strip.</p>

<p>With that in mind the series is going to take a break for a few months while I write better stories (currently I have 10 in the bag) and come back stronger with Season Two.</p>
