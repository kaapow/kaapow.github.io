It appears that my hunt for a Gel ink refill capable of fitting into a Rotring 600 is over..._mostly_. While the [Premec G2](https://fromthepencup.wordpress.com/2018/04/29/is-this-thing-on/) refill seems to tick all the boxes; the only issue being trying to find a viable distributor that ships outside the US?
