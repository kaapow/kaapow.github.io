I have been using the _Bullet Journal Method_ for over 4 years (I know because I’ve kept them all). I’m going to buy the [book](https://www.amazon.com/Bullet-Journal-Method-Present-Design/dp/0525533338/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1524864141&sr=8-1&keywords=the+bullet+journal+method&dpID=61ANWIaIbeL&preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch&linkCode=sl1&tag=thebulletjournal-20&linkId=9d926320d4bac582c5d4d5554e62a9ed) in part to see if I’ve missed anything new as the method has matured and in part to hand out to people who still don’t know about it.
