Seriously fell down a rabbit hole yesterday. 

1. First was buying [FlowState](http://hailoverman.com/flowstate). 
2. This then led me to discovering [The Most Dangerous Writing App](http://www.themostdangerouswritingapp.com/write.html), and I loved the font.
3. Which turned out to be [Merriweather](https://ebensorkin.wordpress.com). 
4. Once I realised it was on Google Fonts I then went and spent 5 hours putting it to good use on the site. 
5. Hopefully I'll keep these transgressions down to a minimum in the coming future.
