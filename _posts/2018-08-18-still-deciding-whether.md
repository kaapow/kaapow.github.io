Still deciding whether the whole [web-ring](https://indieweb.org/indiewebring) is a good idea or just currently badly executed. I like the idea of pointing people to other sites, but the 🕸💍 doesn't work for me. Also you could spend time on a site looking for the way out, only to discover that there is none.
