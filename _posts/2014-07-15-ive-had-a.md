<img src="https://www.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/bc335cad5d.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="541" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-194" /><p>I&rsquo;ve had a <a href="http://www.pinboard.in">Pinboard</a> account for several years now. I&rsquo;ve used it reasonably diligently over the years, but it&rsquo;s been one way. Links get put into it, but are hardly every taken out of it.</p>

<p>The main reason behind this has been the available interfaces for using this particular service have been diabolically rubbish. That includes the native online experience.</p>

<p>Over the years I&rsquo;ve hunted in the App store to find a solution and the available ones felt over-priced and didn&rsquo;t meet my requirements. Enter <a href="http://bananafishsoftware.com/products/spillo/">Spillo</a> by Bananafish Software. Exquisite is the only way to describe this app.</p>

<p>Although there are a plethora of features that I love, my favourite has to be the smart collections. Now at least, when I really don&rsquo;t want to have something that clutters up my Evernote collections, there is a space for it here in Spillo.</p>
