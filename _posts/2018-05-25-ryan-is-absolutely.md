Ryan is absolutely **fascinated** by music. 

I stumbled onto this fact by mistake (it feels that parenting is a series of mistakes upwards). When he was only a couple of months old I would sing to calm him down. I chose songs I knew by Smashing Pumpkins, Soundgarden and Metallica.

We've now transitioned to the real thing which has (obviously) increased his verve for beautiful sounds, rather than his dad's poor screetching.
