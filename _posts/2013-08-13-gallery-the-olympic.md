<strong>The Olympic City</strong>

<p>The <a href="http://olympiccityproject.com">Olympic City</a> is an ongoing photography project by Jon Pack and Gary Hustwit (director of the Helvetica, Objectified and <a href="http://urbanizedfilm.com">Urbanized</a> documentaries) that looks at the legacy of the Olympic Games in former host cities around the world.</p>

<p>The printed version is limited to 1000 copies, and retails for $100. However there is much more affordable (and manageable) digital copy which can be found <a href="http://versionspublishing.com">here</a>.</p>
