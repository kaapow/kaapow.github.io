I thought it would be interesting to run some numbers on all the Kickstarter projects that I have backed over the years.

I started contributing to crowd funded projects back in October 2014.
I’ve spent around $1300 over 3½ years and 19 Kickstarter projects. 

Breaking all the projects down by _loose_ categories, it’s clear I go through waves of interest. Currently I’m in a book and software buying phase and over the stationary phase.

| Category | No. |
|:--|:--|
| Accessory | 7 |
| Stationary| 5 |
| Books | 4 |
| Software | 2 |
| Video | 1 |

Diving a little deeper into each project:

| No. | Project Name | Type | Notes | Usefulness |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 1 | [Bullet Journal](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1562027630/bullet-journal-journaling-at-the-speed-of-life) | Stationary | Still in the plastic bag. I’m happy to have helped Ryder on his journey and own a piece of ‘stationary history’ in the meantime. | ✓ |
| 2 | [Takumi Pen](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1774020211/takumi-pen-a-minimal-and-versatile-stationery) | Stationary | This was the first version of this pen. I was disappointed. It was too light and overall the execution was flawed. Some of these flaws were rectified in the new version. | ✗ |
| 3 | [A leather belt to last a lifetime](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/997949183/a-leather-belt-to-last-a-lifetimetwo-if-you-count) | Accessory | I grew fatter and never wore the belt. It’s not the product’s fault, I’ve just never used it…yet. | ✗ |
| 4 | [Memobottle](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1645027465/memobottle-a4-a5-and-letter-reusable-water-bottles) | Accessory | I live in the Middle East. I need cold water. This is a plastic bottle, doesn’t keep the water cool enough. Maybe I will get some use out of it in the future. Well executed project. | ✗ |
| 5 | [Bomber Duffle Bag](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tmdesign/bomber-barrel-bag) | Accessory | Use it when necessary. Excellent product. Highly recommended. | ✓ |
| 6 | [Precision Coffee Grinder](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/handground/precision-coffee-grinder-better-grind-more-flavor) | Accessory | Took years to get to me. Then I learnt how to make cold brew and this was too much effort. Useful to have in the house, but not essential. | ✗ | 
| 7 | [PENXO](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bitsfactory/penxo-the-most-minimalistic-2mm-lead-holder-pencil) | Stationary | Love the design. Doesn’t get as much use as I’d like. | ✓ |
| 8 | [TIO](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tio/tio-save-the-world-twice-a-day) | Accessory | Nice concept. Too difficult to re-order in the UAE. Used for 6 months and that was it. | ✗ |
| 9 | [Tactile Turn Slider & Glider](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/eimim/tactile-turn-slider-and-glider-simply-the-best-bol) | Stationary | Loved the design. Totally disappointed by the fact that it’s too thick and the nipple falls off regularly. | ✗ |
| 10 | [Sento Towel](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1700119410/sento-towel-an-incredible-upgrade-for-an-everyday) | Accessory | Does what it says on the tin. I love these towels and use the every day. | ✓ | 
| 11 | [The Pen Addict Live 2017](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/637878316/the-pen-addict-live-2017-relaycon-atlanta-and-dc-p) | Video | Video was fine, except it didn’t really add very much to the overall experience. I would have wanted more stuff around the actual convention itself, and maybe some interviews. Alas the boys limit it to the actual show itself only. | ✓ | 
| 12 | [Indie Microblogging](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/manton/indie-microblogging-owning-your-short-form-writing) | Software | Can’t believe how little I paid for this initially, but it’s been great value for money, as all of my writing is being filtered through Micro.blog. | ✓ | 
| 13 | [Illustrated Classics by Pope, Shimizu & Sienkiewicz](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/beehivebooks/illustrated-classics-by-pope-shimizu-and-sienkiewi) | Book | Still waiting. | - | 
| 14 | [Single Edge Razor 2.0](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/supply/the-single-edge-safety-razor-20?ref=nav_search&result=project&term=single%20edge%20razor) | Accessory | Use this every other day. It’s not transformed the way I shave, but it’s provided me with a nice alternative. | ✓ |
| 15 | [The Electric State](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1192053011/the-electric-state-simon-stalenhags-new-narrative) | Book | Great looking book, but I’ve not read it yet. | ✓ | 
| 16 | [Change Is Good](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1671130551/change-is-good-the-collectors-first-edition) | Book | Still waiting. | - | 
| 17 | [Krama Pens & Pencil](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kramastudio/krama-pens-and-pencil-luxuriously-handcrafted-inst) | Stationary | The metal version arrived, and it’s excellent. Still waiting for the plastic version. | ✓ | 
| 18 | [Inspire](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/120326342/inspire-the-art-of-viktor-kalvachev) | Book | Still waiting. | - | 
| 19 | [iA Writer for Windows](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/reichenstein/a-focused-writing-app-for-windows) | Software | Very useful. Use it in work nearly every day. | ✓ | 

* * * 

What’s not on this list is the plethora of projects that I did **not** end up backing and a couple of projects that I ended up buying things directly after the kickstarter project was already over.

Taking the last column and summarising it a little shows me that it’s _generally_ been a positive experience and I’m either using the products or aim to use them in the future:

| No Regret | Some Regret | Jury’s Out |
|:--|:--|:--|
| 10 | 6 | 3 |

Going forward my plan is, with regards to Kickstarter, to be a **lot** more discerning and selective in the projects that I back. Where I see something truly unique and special, that is where I should concentrate my efforts.
