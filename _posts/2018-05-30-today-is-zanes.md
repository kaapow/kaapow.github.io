Today is Zaneâ€™s 4th birthday. 

After Ryan was born late last year, I have gotten to know Zane and take a much bigger role in shaping the person he is and will be (until school and his friends take over). It strikes me how truly incredible the amount of time, energy, love, tears, worry, joy, sleep (or lack of it) goes into nurturing your child, yet feeling the need to do more as a parent.
