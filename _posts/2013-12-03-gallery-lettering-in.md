In creating <a href="http://moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a>, it was very clear to me early on that the lettering would have to be a character in itself. My initial attempts at lettering involved hand lettering, in the end I opted for some great fonts from the <a href="http://comicraft.com">Comicraft</a> library.
