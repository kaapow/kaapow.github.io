I've never been one to look up to people as role models and yet this quote, from Seneca, has stuck with me these last few days:

> There is a need, in my view, for someone as a standard against which our characters can measure themselves. Without a ruler to do it against you won't make the crooked straight.  
â€” _Seneca_

Such a great metaphor to capture one's struggle to improve yourself, or **straighten** yourself.
