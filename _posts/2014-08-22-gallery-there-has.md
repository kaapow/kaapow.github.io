<p>There has been a lot of internet chatter about these pencils, enough to have coloured me completely intrigued. Wonderful story by Mois√©s Chiullan over at <a href="http://imprint.neededition.com/post/95309048215/borrowed-blackwings">Imprint</a>.</p>

<p>These things aren&rsquo;t cheap. They currently retail for $20 for 12 pencils (that&rsquo;s $1.67 per pencil). The box I&rsquo;ve shown above is the <a href="http://palominobrands.com/product/blackwing-grand-piano-box/#product_images%5Bgrouped%5D/0/">grand piano box</a>, which retails for $50 (but I&rsquo;ve not really been able to find one as they seem completely sold out).</p>

<p>The pencil comes in 3 variants. The one recommended for artists is the <a href="http://palominobrands.com/product/palomino-blackwing/">Blackwing</a> (comes in the black colour), although the <a href="http://palominobrands.com/product/palomino-blackwing-602/">602</a> appears to be the general purpose pencil used by all the greats&hellip;</p>
