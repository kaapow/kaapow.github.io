I hesitanted to get the first issue of the _Full Bleed_ ‘magazine’ from IDW, and regretted it. [Issue two](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/41834867/full-bleed-vol-2-deep-cuts?ref=home_featured) is on Kickstarter and there is a tier to get both issues for those that missed out the first time. Looks like the natural successor to _The Comics Journal_ printed version, which I loved.
