One of the things I’m currently working on is the coloured version of the characters.

One of the comments that’s been made to me is that the black and white version of the strip is holding back potential readers. Some just are not all that into <strong>glorious</strong> black & white comic art - it feels, <em>unfinished</em>. This week’s strip will be an experiment to see whether or not that really is the case.
