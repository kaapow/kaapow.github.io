<p>Sometimes a design comes from behind you and actually surprises you. I knew that I wanted to have a unique design for this site, however I wasn&rsquo;t sure what form it would take or how long it would take me to get there.</p>

<p>One of the main design points is that much of the Tumblr specific posts are &lsquo;hidden&rsquo; (they can all be accessed in the <a href="http://khaledaboualfa.co/archive">archive</a> section), as I wanted the front page to be more about my personal writing rather than the larger image posts. This means expect a great deal more posting in the near future.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve not visited the site, <a href="http://khaledaboualfa.co">come have a look</a>.</p>
