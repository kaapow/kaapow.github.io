<p>Image Comics is now allowing you to keep the digital copies of the comics you buy from them - about bloody time. What&rsquo;s also incredibly interesting however is the percentage of the sales that the digital copies account for the overall sales of the publisher. Last year it was 12%, this year they&rsquo;re projecting 15%.</p>

<p>Will the digital percentage ever surpass the actual physical monthly books? I think this is inevitable and actually a great thing for the creators. The main point is to put the books in the hands of people that want to read them (and pay for them) regardless of the format.</p>

<p>I stopped buying monthly comic books years ago. However I would definitely consider buying digital comics and then a trade collection if the art, story and overall package warranted it.</p><br /><a href='http://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/07/drm-free-comics-download-image/'>Own your Digital Image Comics</a>
