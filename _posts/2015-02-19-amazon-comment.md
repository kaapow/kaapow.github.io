<p>How often do you read a comment to a review on Amazon and can&rsquo;t stop laugh? This comment for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HYOGTTG">Zojirushi SM-SA48-BA Stainless Steel Mug</a> is one of those.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I bought the 20-ounce Zojirushi SM-SA60-BA the week after I got married so that I could keep my coffee warm on the commute to and from my new job downtown. It is literally the world&rsquo;s best travel mug. I could put steaming hot coffee in it in the morning, and if I forgot it in my truck I would still have steaming hot coffee for the drive home. No kidding! It&rsquo;s incredible. This was an exciting time for me. My time with Jennifer was limited but boundless in its glory. When I wasn&rsquo;t working, Jennifer and I would go hiking at the park, take road trips, sit up late and watch the stars. And, of course, have long nights of passionate love making. And through it all, my 20-ounce Zojirushi SM-SA60-BA provided me with hot, fresh coffee and a sleek, ergonomic feel. It&rsquo;s amazingly well designed and made to last.That was seven years ago.</p>

<p>He then follows it up with this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These days, Jennifer is as cold and emotionally distant as an uncharted asteroid. Now the most passionate conversations we have involve either our fiberoptic internet bandwidth or Your Damn Mother. At work, I am merely a shadow defined by once-authentic ambition. Original thought at my office is as pointless as a Libertarian vote, and my commute is like a scene from Walking Dead. I&rsquo;m writing this on my iPhone as I sit behind a third-world chicken truck on I-35. I&rsquo;m numbing myself to waste another eight hours at The Bad Place and fantasizing about replacing the painful vacuum of affection from She Who Cannot Read Oil Change Reminder Stickers with that new girl from logistics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And ends strongly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But now that I think about it, the one constant source of warmth and comfort in my life is still the 20-ounce Zojirushi SM-SA60-BA. Buy one. Buy one now, or feel only the chill yearning for an early grave that poor life decisions and emotional complacency can reap.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also bonus, read the followup <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R37USG0ZWZUEQM/ref=cm_cr_dp_cmt?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00HYOGUM2&amp;nodeID=284507&amp;store=kitchen#wasThisHelpful">comments</a> which give the actual truth, which is a lot more heartwarming.</p>
