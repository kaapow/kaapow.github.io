üçø I hardly ever get the chance to watch movies but on the latest [Recomendo](http://recomendo.com/issues/free-blog-domains-habits-of-a-happy-brain-explore-org-147031) issue, I was gifted a couple of hours today and decided to watch [Icarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icarus_(2017_film)), one of the best documentaries I've seen in a long time complete with engaging protagonists, story and music.
