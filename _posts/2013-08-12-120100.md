<p>One of my absolute favourite artists, Hiroaki Samura draws Manji from his manga series &lsquo;Blade of the Immortal&rsquo;. What I love about this video is how Samura achieves the soft shadows and shading - lots of pencil and delicate eraser work, over the basic image which is light boarded from below.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also interesting to see that he&rsquo;s using some tracing paper to avoid smudging his work as it&rsquo;s mainly pencil work and doesn&rsquo;t involve any inking.</p>
