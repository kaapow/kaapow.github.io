This story of [older Japanese women are shoplifting to find community in jail](https://kottke.org/18/03/older-japanese-women-are-shoplifting-to-find-community-and-meaning-in-jail) is heartbreaking. As my parents have entered their retirement years, Iâ€™m always thankful that they have each other, especially considering both myself and brother don't live in the same country as them.
