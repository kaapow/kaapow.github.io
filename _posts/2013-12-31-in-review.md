<p>When you reflect back on a year, the hope is always to find a number of moments that put a smile on your face - thankfully these last 12 months have given me with a lot to smile about.</p>

<p>Getting the news that I am going to become a father was the definite highlight - a fact which I’ve honestly not wrapped my head completely around, but I’ve started preparing<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Creatively this year is one of my strongest in recent memory. I drew an entire season of <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a>, a slew of additional promotional images and designed the website - although it’s going to get some redesign love in the new year. Surprisingly the comic work didn’t end there as I completely rewrote the script for <em>Chroma</em> (my upcoming comics project) that has been many years in the making.</p>

<p>I redesigned this here site for the umpteenth time, however I do believe that this iteration is by far my most mature attempt and probably one that I will likely not change fundamentally for many years to come. The aspects of the site that I am most happy with are the colours and the typography, which is the first time in many years that I am ahead of the curve in certain respects (small caps only valid in certain browsers, surprisingly not Safari/Webkit proper).</p>

<p>Finally I started work on two iOS apps. The first one, we’ve scrapped and shelved, the other I hope we get some traction in the new year and we finally ship something, because as we all know:</p>

<p>Here’s wishing everyone a great 2014.</p>

<p>This year I started getting into photography a little bit more. I want to make sure that I am capable of capturing my son or daughter’s life in the most beautiful way - like every self respecting geek father should. <a href="1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
