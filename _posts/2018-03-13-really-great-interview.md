Really great interview on [Thoroughly Considered](https://www.relay.fm/tc/35), with Max Temkin. Got me interested in actually purchasing a 'copy' of [Cards Against Humanity](https://www.relay.fm/tc/35). And while I'm at it, maybe something from [Studio Neat](https://www.studioneat.com) - show my support.
