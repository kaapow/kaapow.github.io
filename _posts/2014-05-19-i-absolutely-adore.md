<img src="https://www.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/00629db0da.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="1090" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-220" /><p>I absolutely <em>adore</em> these adverts created by AMC as their markers for the upcoming Emmy awards - see the rest of them at the <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/emmys-mad-men-stars-hawk-703018">Hollywood Reporter</a>. One of the things that I&rsquo;ll miss about Mad Men (when the series is over) are the colours that are attached to this world.</p>
