When I was a kid, I used to take my toys apart as I tried to understand what made them work. The internal mechanisms fascinated me.

Todd McLellan takes this to a whole new level, and his forthcoming book ‘<a href="http://thamesandhudsonusa.com/books/things-come-apart-hardcover/">Things Come Apart</a>’ is definitely a celebration of people with a fascination for the internal mechanism of designed objects - or kids like me.
