I've been struggling with thoughts and issues on how to keep going (for a number of aspects in my life). [This talk](https://austinkleon.com/2018/03/28/how-to-keep-going/) by Austin Kleon tackles this topic head first. His answer is found across 10 points ; you should watch the video to get a proper explanation on each:

1. Every day is Groundhog Day
2. Build a bliss station
3. Forget the noun, do the verb
4. Make gifts
5. The ordinary + extra attention = the extraordinary
6. Art is for life (not the other way around)
7. You are allowed to change your mind
8. When in doubt, tidy up
9. The demons hate fresh air
10. Spend time on something that will outlast them
