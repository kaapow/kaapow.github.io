<p>There was a time in the early 2000s, before Twitter was a thing, before Facebook was open to anyone but University students, when the Internet was a smaller place, or at least if felt like it.</p>

<p>There was a time when communicating was easy, and your voice could be heard (amongst the cacophony around you), even if it was faint and fleeting.</p>

<p>There was a time when blogging was being part of a community. There was a time, which now is gone.</p>
