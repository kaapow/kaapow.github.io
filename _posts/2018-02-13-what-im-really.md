What I'm really appreciating about Mb is how much better it is than blogging back in 2004. Back then we used to rely on pingbacks to tell someone else we mentioned or linked to something they wrote. This is infinitely better. Except that I don't have a copy of my [@replies](https://micro.blog/replies)...
