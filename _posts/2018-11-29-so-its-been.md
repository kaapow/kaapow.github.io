So it's been three long years since we moved to Dubai. At the time I'd just read Marie Kondo's book and it was amazingly eye opening. We have a four day weekend ahead of us and it seems it's likely going to be a miserable affair on account of the kids and wife having caught the flu. Mission to make this place lighter will begin tomorrow. Inbetween making the family as comfortable as I can, I'll be throwing things out.
