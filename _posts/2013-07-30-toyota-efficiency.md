<p>This story on Kottke, really made me smile. I remember going to a Toyota talk in Greece, some 3 years ago when this business management process was talked about. This is a beautiful example of reviewing how something is done, make some minor tweaks and then creating something infinitely more efficient.</p><br /><a href='http://kottke.org/13/07/toyota-donates-efficiency-to-non-profit'>Toyota efficiency</a>
