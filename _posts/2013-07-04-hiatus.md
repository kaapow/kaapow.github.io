<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking that it&rsquo;s important to take a step back from the site. There is a better way. Unfortunately I have no idea what that is.</p>

<p>I will be back for sure (and hopefully better for it), however I feel that I need to take a break, regroup, come back stronger.</p>

<p>So as of now (but not for ever) Broken Kode will be on hiatus.</p>
