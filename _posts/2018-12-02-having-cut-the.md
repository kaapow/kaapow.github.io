Having cut the cord on cable TV, there are two things I miss. Live sports and **great** adverts (I know). Thankfully [Sandwich video](https://sandwichvideo.com) has me sorted on the second of those. Their latest [Vote.org](https://sandwichvideo.com/projects/how-to-vote) and [Fracture](https://sandwichvideo.com/projects/picture-your-life) videos are great.
