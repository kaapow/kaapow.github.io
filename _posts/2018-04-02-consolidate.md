I feel like I need to quantify that previous statement, because I might not be alone.

Over the last 14 years that I’ve been online I’ve meandered from platform to platform: _Blogger, Moveable Type, Wordpress, Habari, Scriptogram, Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter, Medium, Flickr, Instagram, Blot and now Micro.blog_. 

Listing them all like this it makes me wonder why I’ve had such a haphazard affair with something as simple as writing your thoughts online.

Throughout this journey I have either kept the words that I’ve written (or have clear access to these). The plan is to bring **everything** under one roof. The biggest challenge is deciding what to keep (what is _really_ worth keeping). Will write a bit about my process once it's all done.
