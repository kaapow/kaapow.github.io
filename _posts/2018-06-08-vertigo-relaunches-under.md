[Vertigo relaunches under Mark Doyle](http://www.comicsbeat.com/dont-call-it-a-comeback-vertigo-relaunches-under-mark-doyle-with-seven-new-series/) with seven new series. The three series that jumped out at me were _American Carnage_, _Goddess Mode_ and especially _High Level_. Love the trade dress which is very _Vertigo_.
