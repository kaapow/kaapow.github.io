⚽ Notes on the Iceland vs Nigeria game:
- Hoping Iceland pull an equaliser against Nigeria, along with Mexico they're my two favourite _underdog_ teams.
- How the hell did Nigeria just score twice in 20 minutes? Where Argentina had no way in?
- VAR comes to their rescue...and he hoofs the penalty. What is going on with the penalties this World Cup?
- Argentina can actually make it through to the next round now, after their abysmal performance yesterday to Croatia.
- Both goals by Musa are some of the best _individual_ performance goals I've seen in the world cup. Didn't think they had it in them to be honest. 
- A great second half in this game, makes this group qualifying a fascinating one to watch.
