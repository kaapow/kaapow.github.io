<img src="https://www.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/f57c8d0cdb.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="420" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-115" /> I just published the first full colour <em>Moon Racket!</em> strip, <a href="http://moonracket.com/post/123948318799/taking-a-minute" class="tumblr_blog">Taking a Minute</a>. I’ll be getting into my overall setup at some point, but this is a decided shift from me as I have until now published only in black and white.

This is not a sign that <strong>I</strong> no longer believe in black & white, but maybe rather the strip is better served on the internet with a splash of colour - I’ll report on whether that theory holds water after a few of these have gone out, but my feeling is that this small change will make a noticable difference.

As this is still the first one, like with most strips, there will be an evolution of the colour art as I get more comfortable with the process and try different ideas.The only downside, is that the <em>Moon Racket!</em> website will now have to be tweaked slightly to capture this colour palette (which is slightly different from previous iterations of colour that I’ve used in promo art).
