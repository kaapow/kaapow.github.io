One of the single most powerful things that I hope to teach my kids, is to understand and appreciate the concept of consistent & incremental. This applies to aspects of themselves and in everything around them. As long as you **increment** on a thing you're working on and **consistently** show up every day you will eventually see results. 

The hardest part is to percevier in the face of no visible improvement and keep moving forward. Set your course because you know it is true and try and remain on it.
