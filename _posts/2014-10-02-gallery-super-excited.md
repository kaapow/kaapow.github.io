Super excited to finally have received these in the mail yesterday. I did also have one third t-shirt made in a slate colour with the <a href="http://moonracket.com">Moon Racket! </a>logo on it, but unfortunately there was a printing error on that one, so Iâ€™m waiting on some replacements.

Having said all of that, there is a unique joy in having designed something  and then seeing it as a physical object, even if it is as simple as a T-shirt.
