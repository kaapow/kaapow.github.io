Just finished listening to [James Dyson's interview](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510313/how-i-built-this) on _How I built this_ (excellent episode btw), he let out that he's building an electric car. Then there's this interview on the [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/564aa742-0cac-11e8-8eb7-42f857ea9f09). If James Dyson getting into EVs doesn't excite you, you're wired wrong (pun **totally** intended).
