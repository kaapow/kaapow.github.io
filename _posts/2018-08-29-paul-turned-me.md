Paul turned me onto Russell Brand’s podcast [Under The Skin](https://www.russellbrand.com/podcasts/). I’m halfway through episode 03 with Adam Curtis and have the same feeling I do when I get through an issue of the Economist. Even Brand’s accent (not a fan) can’t hide the smartness and thoughtfulness on display.
