<p>Every once in a while you stumble upon an idea that resonates with you. An idea that captures your imagination. It’s a unique idea that asks for action, that calls to be implemented and put into action and to become part of your daily practice. The latest such idea is <strong>Stoicism</strong>.</p>

<p>Although my brother had mentioned it in passing a while back, the information washed over me like someone telling me all about Bitcoin. I paid it no heed and carried on about my daily business.</p>

<p>In one of the latest episodes of the <a href="http://www.thejournal.email/podcast">Kevin Rose Show podcast</a>, Kevin Rose interviewed <a href="https://ryanholiday.net">Ryan Holiday</a> and what he said made a ton of sense to me, so I decided to take a deeper dive.</p>

<p>I jumped straight to Marcus Aurelius’ <em>Meditations</em> and bought two versions. The first is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meditations-Translation-Marcus-Aurelius-2003-05-06/dp/B01N4HXUYQ/ref=sr_1_7?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1506162209&amp;sr=1-7&amp;keywords=meditations">Gregory Hays translation</a> recommended by Holiday. The second is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Emperors-Handbook-New-Translation-Meditations/dp/0743233832/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1506162209&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=meditations">The Emperor’s Handbook</a>) which my brother recommended.</p>

<p>I have since followed it up with Ryan Holiday’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Daily-Stoic-Meditations-Wisdom-Perseverance/dp/0735211736?tag=dailystoic07-20">Daily Stoic</a> as a good way to allow the ideas and ideology be digested in small bite sized nuggets. Of note is Holiday’s <a href="https://dailystoic.com">website</a> dedicated to spreading the Stoic word — subscribing to his newsletter gives you a decent sampler to know if this is something you’d like to dig a little deeper into.</p>

<p>The one exercise that I have taken to heart straight away is daily journaling twice a day. 10–15 minutes in the morning to capture what I want to achieve out of the day and 10–15 minutes in the evening to review and reflect on the day that passed and ask myself what I learnt and what I could do better.</p>
