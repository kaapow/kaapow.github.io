One of the things that has been completely invaluable to us this first year of Zane’s life has been the show <em>Baby Einstein</em>. Living away from any family that can help us with the boy has been a challenge at times, but these 22 programmes have acted like a baby sitter of sorts to keep him occupied briefly while we do things like eating our dinner, cleaning up the kitchen or putting a laundry - you know the super exciting things in life.

Zane <em>loves</em> these characters. Something about them strike a real cord with him. So when his first birthday came about, I knew we had to celebrate with them. I’m planning on getting the art behind these characters made as a print soon to hang up in his room.

What’s amazing to me is just how great the cake came out, it’s a technology I’ve seen used before (as I was reminded by my wife), but I’ve never done anything with it. Here’s to many more happy birthday’s Zane. What a year it’s beeen.
