<p>Earlier this year I contemplated shutting down Broken Kode, a site that has been part of the internet landscape since January 2004, a total of nearly 10 years online. In a last attempt to keep the name and the site alive I tried changing things around to see if I could maintain my enthusiasm for it.</p>

<p>My first attempt was to try and focus on all things Tesla Motors. However I quickly realised that actually I was writing to an audience of one (myself) and that I wasnâ€™t enjoying the process all that much. My next idea was to use the site as a simple Tumblr, a digital drawer for things that others created. My attempts can still be read <a href="http://khaledaboualfa.tumblr.com">here</a>.</p>

<p>Ultimately I felt that the site deserved better treatment. In the last few months I have started publishing my comic work, on <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a> and I have several other projects in the pipeline as well. So this site will be used as a way to log my ideas and showcase the creative process, in the attempt to better understand what I am doing and how I could be doing it better. The posts on this site will be more limited, however each and every one will be infinitely more <em>personal</em>.</p>
