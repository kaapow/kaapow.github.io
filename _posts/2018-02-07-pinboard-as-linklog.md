As I start to rekindle my love for writing and publishing online again (I’m still trying to decide on another word to _blogging_, a term I dislike the sound of), I’ve decided that I actually don’t want to clutter up my feed with a linklog - even if this link log has some exceptionally witty commentary. I’d like to keep this particular site dedicated to my more _thoughtful_ digital explorations. 

What I hadn’t considered was the power of the system that I actually have in place already in my [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:kaa/public/) account. Interesting links already exist there. The only part of this system I’ve not really been using is the description or notes section. You can subscribe to the RSS feed [here](http://feeds.pinboard.in/rss/u:kaa/).

What is really annoying to me is that I’ve had this Pinboard account for 6 years and never thought to invest the time in it before now.
