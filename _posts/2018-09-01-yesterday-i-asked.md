Yesterday I asked for an alternative to [Tinyletter](http://tinyletter.com) and [Buttondown](http://buttondown.email) was recommended. Having spent a day kicking the tires, this now joins a small pantheon of indie web services that I want to support. Need an email service that can join [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in), [Micro.blog](http://micro.blog), [Feedbin](http://feedbin.me) and [Buttondown](http://buttondown.email).
