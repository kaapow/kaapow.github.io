I got a bunch of Shinhan Art pens last week. I was so excited to use them that this little image popped out in a matter of minutes. One of the most encouraging things about sticking with a bunch of characters is watching their evolution happen before your eyes. There is a confidence that Iâ€™m aware of and actually <em>really</em> enjoying experiencing at the moment. I just wish I could do this more regularly.
