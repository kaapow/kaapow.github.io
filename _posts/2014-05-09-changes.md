<p>There was a time in my life where I remember that I resented change. It was something that I later came to understand was actually a major component of life. Major change can either come in regular doses, or can wait dormantly, in the shadows for years. </p>

<p>Change is <em>everywhere</em> at the moment. </p>

<p>We’re gearing up for our first baby’s imminent arrival, which has honestly completely consumed our every free moment. </p>

<p>At work, yesterday was Naresh and Max’s last day onsite. I sat next to Naresh for the last 2 years as we saw the building go from a hole in the ground to something much, much more. We’ve effectively been in the ‘trenches’ together (at least the engineering/construction trenches) and while we’ve not come out unscratched, I think we’ve both learnt an incredible amount, from each other.</p>

<p>Don’t fight change. Embrace it. Life will be easier that way.</p>
