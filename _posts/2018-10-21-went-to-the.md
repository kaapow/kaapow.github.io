Went to the [Big Bad Wold book](https://www.bigbadwolfbooks.com) fair (the biggest of it's kind in the world). It's so massive that people wander around with supermarket shopping carts filled will books. For my first trip I picked up:
  
1. Graphic Ink by Frank Quietley
2. The Wake by Scott Snyder and Sean Murphy
3. Comics A Global History by Dan Mazur and Alexander Danner
