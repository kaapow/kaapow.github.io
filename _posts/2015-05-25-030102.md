The image that started <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a>.

The incredible part (when you consider the physical and hardware constraints) is that it was all created on an iPhone 4. I’ve written about this before (probably on my now defunct Facebook page), the intention was to create a super <em>simple</em> character that could be easily drawn on that tiny little screen.

As time went on, the character evolved. While I now find him incredibly easy to draw (and can tell instantly when I’ve not done a good job of my lines), that wasn’t always the case.

In fact the first year of Corgan’s life, I wasn’t super comfortable with certain aspects of his drawing him (so much so I remember the very first strip, I thought to trace him as I spent long on the first panel, but quickly realised that I was being stupid and foolish).
