<p>In early 2012 I started work on my first iOS app with my cousin. The trip was long and meandering (one which unfortunately we never completed).</p>

<p>One of the things that I made sure I did was keep all my notes and scribbles in a single notebook. This was a bit of a departure for me, but one that I have maintained for all my future projects. Each project has it&rsquo;s own notebook where most things can be found.</p>

<p>One sketch that I attribute the inking of <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a> to, is the original icon sketch for the app.</p>

<p>The importance of this sketch was in making me appreciate the Muji 0.38mm black gel ink pen as a tool for clean inking and providing the correct thickness of line that I was originally looking for - but couldn&rsquo;t really achieve with my Copic pens.</p>

<p>While this pen isn&rsquo;t completely suitable for the clean lined artwork of <em>Chroma</em>, it still has it&rsquo;s uses for all the cross-hatching required. Sometimes you stumble on a tool that elevates your art, for me it was my Muji gel ink pen.</p>
