If you're looking to create something, anything really, then I seriously encourage you to listen to Seth Godin's podcast _Akimbo_. The previous episode, [You're it](https://www.akimbo.me/blog/s-3-e-2-you-re-it) seriously captures the reason that you should start NOW with that endeavour. Don't wait. You're wasting time. As am I.
