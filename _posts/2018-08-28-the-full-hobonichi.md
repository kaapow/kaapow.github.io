The full Hobonichi Techo 2019 lineup is [now live](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/). I'm going for the Weeks Mega (for work) and an A6 Planner for life. I tend to like having more space to write, but having dates actually keep me coming back to fill them more regularly, compared with my current setup.
