<p>There is much to like about Tumblr and publishing on Tumblr. There are however some constraints that I have been trying to work my way through. <em>High resolution</em> images on Tumblr are constrained in size to 1280px for normal high res photos and 2560x500px for panorama photos.</p>

<p>The problem is that Moon Racket strips don&rsquo;t really fall into either category. I could potentially use the panorama photos setting, but that would mean making things fit into a 500px height (which isn&rsquo;t great). Here&rsquo;s a look of what the panorma would look like using the <a href="http://moonracket.com/post/119418092109/in-plain-sight">latest weekly</a> (which dropped yesterday):</p>

<p>Alternatively I could upload the image as 1280px. On a retina display that works out to be a 640px image (which honestly is tiny). My website allows for a 960px width - on a retina display that&rsquo;s 1920px. If I do let Tumblr do it&rsquo;s thing, then my crisp black lines that I&rsquo;ve worked long and hard on, become this blurred mess.</p>

<p>The only other solution I&rsquo;ve found is to host the images on Flickr and then link them over. I get to post the image that I want in any resolution that I please. This solution does not make for very good Tumblr citizen but it makes for a better web site.</p>

<hr /><p>The irony of course is that both Flickr and Tumblr are owned by Yahoo! - so the image is hosted on their servers anyway. The whole thing is just annoying and you end up loosing out on some of the cool features that are inherently a part of Tumblr - for the sake of a few measily pixels.</p>
