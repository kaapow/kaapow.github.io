Since April I have been working silently and diligently on my little project. I've still got a long while to go before I'm happy to share what's been going on with me but I wanted to share my absolute recommendation for [iAWriter](http://www.ia.net/writer) as one of the best tools for writing projects ever made. 

Of significant value to me is the ability to link in multiple text files into a single document. This has allowed me to reorganise the entire project several times over, as though it was a simple deck of cards. 

This feature alone would be enough for me, but that is just the start of things. It's super lightweight and opens instantly. It doesn't have any font features (except choosing between a single font) and that helps me from wasting type. Although there arent' many templates to choose from, the basic ones included with the app do an amazing job of typesetting the work in a fashion that I can read/markup and edit freely.

Sure I would like a few features found in the [Highland](https://quoteunquoteapps.com/highland-2/) app, such as sprint timer, native fountain support, and actual _comment_ support within the document, but this app provides me with so much and I highly recommend you consider it for your next project.
