I know itâ€™s not October anymore, but I had 2 more sketches that I managed to squeeze during the month, which will bring the grand total to 8 inked images for 2014. At the very least I have something to beat for this month. I enjoyed the process enough to continue trying to do a small sketch as often as I can. Even cracked a new notebook just for this purpose.
