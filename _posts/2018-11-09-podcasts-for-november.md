🎙️ Seeing as I'm in the car for many hours of the day (travelling up and down to Abu Dhabi), I've been listening to a ton of podcasts recently....a metric ton in fact. Here are some of the highlight episodes:
1. [Unfiltered interview with Sir Nick Clegg](https://podtail.com/podcast/unfiltered-with-james-o-brien-joe/sir-nick-clegg-live-by-the-sword-die-by-the-sword/) - essential listening if you're looking to understand Brexit more.
2. [Serial Season Three](https://serialpodcast.org/season-three/about) - I missed season 2, but this season has been very good.
3. [Song Exploder - John Carpenter Halloween Theme](http://songexploder.net/halloween) - Was made even better as we drove in pitch darkness on a moonless night.
4. [Broken Record](https://cms.megaphone.fm/channel/broken-record) - Hey, it's Malcolm Gladwell.
