🇯🇵 Hadn't realised the [extent of the destruction](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2018/09/06/japan-under-siege-first-came-its-worst-typhoon-in-25-years-then-deadly-landslides/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.53a1f6eef71e) on Japan this summer. I have a huge soft spot in my mind and heart for the country. I truly wish them the best in what seems to be a [never ending assault](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/japans-deadly-summer-floods-typhoons-earthquakes-heat/2018/09/06/e6edc320-b1ab-11e8-8b53-50116768e499_story.html?utm_term=.20d66ac5678f) of natural disasters.
