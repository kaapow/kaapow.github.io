<p>I have been working for <a href="http://www.arup.com">Arup</a> for a combined 10 years (my 10 year anniversary is in September). It&rsquo;s a company who&rsquo;s philosophy and culture I obviously subscribe to (otherwise I wouldn&rsquo;t have been here for this many years).</p>

<p>Trying to capture what I experience every day is hard but I&rsquo;ve always felt that in general the people that are employed by the company also subscribe to this philosophy and culture.</p>

<p>Seeing the early roots of the company captured in this video was extremely special for me, considering how I&rsquo;ve seen the company evolve over these last 10 years and no doubt will evolve even more; it all started however with this <em>eccentric</em> gentleman, the philosopher engineer. Everything is measured from the marker he placed in the ground for future generations to see and measure themselves against.</p><div class="attribution">(<span>Source:</span> <a href="https://player.vimeo.com/">https://player.vimeo.com/</a>)</div>
