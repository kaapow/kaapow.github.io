<p>Earlier this year I completed rewriting the script I have been working on for many years now. I originally conceived of the idea in my 20s. Now in my early/mid-30s I&rsquo;ve finally completed the works in a fashion that I believe I can actually start making some progress on this idea by drawing it and eventually publishing it.</p>

<p>Although it&rsquo;s never the tools that make the end product, the right tools remove unnecessary friction. In this regard, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/highland/id499329572">Highland</a> has been an irreplaceable solution for creating scripts. I thoroughly recommend it to all script (and non-script) writers.</p>
