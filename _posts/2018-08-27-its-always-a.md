It's always a joy when I receive an email from Matthew Butterick - go [subscribe](https://tinyletter.com/mbutterick) if type is your thing. His [online book](https://practicaltypography.com) has been revised and I'm seriously considering using [Equity](https://mbtype.com/fonts/equity/) for my next major project.
