I think people like [Kottke](http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/02/last-blog-standing-last-guy-dancing-how-jason-kottke-is-thinking-about-kottke-org-at-20/) and [@Gruber](https://micro.blog/Gruber) are [missing](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/02/14/kottke-on-the-state-of-blogging) something fundamental about the state of blogging. Their small niche of the internet is gone (although some are returning), but there are huge parts of it that exist and continue completely unknown to them.
