It's that time of the year again. New [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/637878316/the-pen-addict-live-2018-relaycon-atlanta-and-toro) for the Pen Addict live show. Quick thoughts:

1. Damn those colours on that case are FUGLY. Brad/Jeff what are you boys thinking?
2. Those pins are too wonky. 
3. _New York_ stationary tour sounds pretty cool.
4. Myke, you've lost weight since the last live show.
