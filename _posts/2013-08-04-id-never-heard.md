I’d never heard of <a href="http://ilyabirman.net">Ilya Birman</a> until this weekend. <a href="http://ilyabirman.net/projects/forebruary/">Forebruary</a> is his latest project, however any of his other <a href="http://ilyabirman.net/projects/">projects</a> are easily just as impressive.

The <a href="http://ilyabirman.net/projects/moscow-metro/">Moscow Metro</a> map is particularly great; clearly the man is a <a href="http://ilyabirman.net/meanwhile/all/london-underground-voice-announcements/">little bit obsessed</a> with all things underground/metro related but it’s my kind of obsessed.
