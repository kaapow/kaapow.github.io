<p>I missed this.</p>

<p>For 10 years I&rsquo;ve published to the internet through <a href="http://www.brokenkode.com">Broken Kode</a>. These last few years that site has meandered a great deal, but has now finally settled down to a very focused topic, which ironically is what is was always intended in the first place, namely a process site for my comic book and creative work.</p>

<p>Although I intend to rebrand it (and therefore discontinue the name that has held up for 10 years), I think the change will be a <em>positive one</em>.</p>

<p>This site (<a href="http://khaledaboualfa.co">khaledaboualfa.co</a>) is wearing it&rsquo;s heart on it&rsquo;s sleeve. There will likely be little focus, which is actually by design. My intention is to give myself the room and space to express myself and my thoughts freely and comment on any topic that happens to capture my imagination at the time. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll get some people to stay for the ride.</p>

<p>Like I said I missed <em>this</em>.</p>
