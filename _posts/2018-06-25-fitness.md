I’ve now been wearing the [Mi Band 2](https://www.mi.com/en/miband2/) for a couple of months. The data has given me the agency to _try_ and change my nature tendencies. 

Unsurprisingly the most useful metric I've found is sleep logging. When did I go to sleep? When did I wake up? How long was my deep sleep for - that's the good kind of sleep right? Right? 

Sleep or the lack of it definitely is what affects me the most throughout my day - I might eat more or less, I might have a headache or not.

The behaviour that I was hoping for the most influence is the amount of exercise I carry out. This is still an ongoing project as I need to carve the correct time in my schedule to do the exercise. **Operation summer** is going to try and finally get into shape.
