While it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that you're writing on your website for the 'internet', the truth of the matter is that you're actually writing these things and obsessing about it's design primarily and sometimes exclusively for yourself.

These words are a snapshot in time. Of where you were and what you were doing. They might be reflections on what happened in your day or what's currently captured your imagination. 

Why not just write this in a journal you say? Because 'publishing' something on a site provides a level of finality. A level of accomplishment that a mere text file in a folder, or a journal entry in your notebook doesn't provide. Not that there is anything wrong with either of those approaches, rather the online published version is _different_.

One of my favourite new feature/plugins on [Micro.blog](http://micro.blog) is ability to [create an 'on-this-day' page](https://github.com/cleverdevil/micromemories) that collects your past posts that happened....erm, on this day.

The reason it's so great is that it's another clear tool, made for you. It's made to allow you to reflect on what you've written in the past and what you were thinking 1, 2, 3 or more years ago. If you're not _using_ this feature, then you're missing out on one of the joys about blogging, which is reflecting on what you've written.
