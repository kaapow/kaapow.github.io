<p>During the last 9 months leading up to Zane&rsquo;s arrival, Yasmine decided it was <s>good</s> necessary that we listen only to classical music when travelling in the car. As she is also against Bluetooth (and technology in general), we actually bought several CDs for the car.</p>

<p>The outcome of this antiquated method of listening to music basically meant that we were listening to the same CDs <em>on repeat</em>. Earlier this evening Zane was a little upset, so we put on the CD.</p>

<p>The first track is J.S.Bach&rsquo;s Concerto in D Minor for 2 Violins, BWV 1043. Within seconds of the first note being played, Zane&rsquo;s face honestly lit up and he smiled in a way we&rsquo;ve not seen since he was born. They really can hear everything in the womb.</p>
