So now that [Sunlit](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sunlit/id1334727769?ls=1&mt=8) 2.2 has been released, I'm considering jettisoning myself from Instagram. The only missing feature for me is the ability to my photos as a collection of thumbnails (in the app or online). Hopefully that will come in future iterations.
