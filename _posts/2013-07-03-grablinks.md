<p>While I love me some Terpstra, I typically can&rsquo;t use much of the things that he creates and shares on a regular basis (not because I don&rsquo;t want to but because most of the stuff flies completely over my head). Having said that GrabLinks is easily a bookmarklet I&rsquo;ve been looking for.</p>

<p>Grab all the links on a page, ready to use, as formatted Markdown links.</p><br /><a href='http://brettterpstra.com/2013/07/03/saving-batches-of-links-from-web-pages/'>GrabLinks</a>
