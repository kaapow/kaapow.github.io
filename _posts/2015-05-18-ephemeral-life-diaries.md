<p>You know what I miss? I miss <em>daily</em> blogging.</p>

<p>5 years ago, the last time I was blogging on any regular basis, there was a rhythm to my publishing madness. Every morning would bring with it the promise of writing something new; sometimes it would be trivial, other times it would be &lsquo;important&rsquo;. The trick was to <em>show up every day</em>.</p>

<p>The last year has honestly stripped me of very little personal time as I juggle being a husband, a father and an engineer. What little spare time I do have, I try and relax by drawing, inking, reading or watching a little bit of television as time permits.</p>

<p>In that respect my online worlds are effectively extensions of a <em>life diary</em> that I’m creating piece by piece. I might own the content, but it’s hosted by someone else.</p>

<hr /><p>When I sit and consider what I’ve created over the last several years, my online endeavours are not high on that priority list. I&rsquo;ve created countless websites, written at this stage thousands of posts (large and small) and while it did provide me with an outlet, none of it will last very long. Maybe none of it will matter except as a marker from a different time in my life.</p>

<p>My online space has now become somewhat diluted across multiple platforms (an <a href="http://www.instagram.com/khaledaboualfa">Instagram</a>, several Tumblrs, a couple of Twitters, a <a href="http://www.dribbble.com/khaledaboualfa">Dribbble</a>, a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/khaledaboualfa">Flickr</a>, a <a href="http://tinyletter.com/moonracket">Tinyletter</a>). What happens is that I end up not generating as much content for each platform but what I&rsquo;ve realised is that this might not actually matter. What matters is work that I find <em>meaningful</em> that will last.</p>

<p>Which then leads to be to start questioning my general output. What work can I look back on objectively and be proud of? Over the last 4 &frac12; years my output has been limited to all things <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a>. This was a pretty concious decision on my part. Focus on a single project allows it to grow it&rsquo;s potential. This is the work that I have devoted my free time for, and this is the work that I hope will blossom over the coming year.</p>
