<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve started listening to the podcast <a href="http://hellointernet.fm">Hello Internet </a> - if you&rsquo;ve not had a chance i recommend you listen and actually try and stick through it as its a pretty good conversation between two interesting hosts.</p>

<p>Just finished episode 3 (although I&rsquo;ve also listened to a few of the later episodes, and then jumped back) but the concept of 4 dials or light bulbs in ones life was discussed. The concept stuck with me however what I realised is that actually my dials are different due to my physical location. So to recap the original four dials:</p>

<ul><li>Family</li>
<li>Work</li>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Friends</li>
</ul><p>What I&rsquo;ve realised is that while the first 3 items remain relevant in my life, the last one however has dropped effectively to 0%. In its place my <em>comic book</em> work has taken its place.</p>

<p>When we moved over to Doha the idea of starting fresh with no support network to start from was a daunting one. The truth is, we&rsquo;ve not actually really developed this support network in any way since we moved here 3 years ago. Apart from the guys in the office, I&rsquo;ve really not ventured very far in this realm. I try and maintain my connections with my friends, but seeing as they are far away, this was one aspect that I knew was going to take a hit. The concious decision was that we didn&rsquo;t expand that circle at all.</p>

<h3>By the Numbers</h3>

<p>This is effectively what my percentages look like at the moment:</p>

<ul><li>Family: 30%</li>
<li>Work: 50%</li>
<li>Health: 5%</li>
<li>Comics: 10%</li>
<li>Downtime: 5%</li>
</ul><p>Will I ever become a professional cartoonist? Not when I only am dedicating 10% of my energy to the task, it&rsquo;s really at best, a hobby, a simple side project. My job as an engineer isn&rsquo;t going away any time soon and my family time and health time are as low as I&rsquo;m going to go at the moment.</p>

<p>The only part that I could take away is the downtime (watching movies, television, surfing the internet, reading a book or magazine). Those things however are important to keep you sane.</p>

<p>The problem I have with this breakdown is that the reality of the situation is such that I am actually using that 10% and doing wonders with it. I&rsquo;ve been able to create multiple websites that I run quasi-regularly. I&rsquo;ve been able to create a web comic that I&rsquo;ve invested an incredible amount of time to write, draw and now publish. I do acknowledge however that this has been at the expense of other things, and that&rsquo;s fine for the moment, but it&rsquo;s not going to stay like that for very long.</p>
