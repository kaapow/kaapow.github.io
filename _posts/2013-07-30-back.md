<p>So the hiatus lasted about a month. I&rsquo;ve had some ideas on what I want to do with the site. This is where I collect things, mainly for myself, however you might find them useful for your own purposes as well.</p>

<p>I have found that when I write something brief about a link, I tend to remember it better, which means I might actually use that information, or revisit that link, rather than it collecting cyber-cob webs in Pinboard (which is a great service) and usually never seen again (which is a great shame).</p>

<p>Longform writing will be happening on <a href="https://medium.com/@khaledaboualfa">Medium</a>.</p>
