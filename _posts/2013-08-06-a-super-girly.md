<p>While listening to the <a href="http://newdisrupt.org/blog/2013/7/31/episode-34-do-toy-with-my-affections-with-erika-moen">latest episode</a> of the <a href="http://newdisrupt.org/">New Disruptors</a> (one of the best podcasts if you&rsquo;re not already listening), I was introduced to the works of Erika Moen. What I find truly beautiful about this comic, which is true about most online comics series, is how much better they get from the <a href="http://www.darcomic.com/2004/01/01/whatthefuck/">first page</a>, to the last page.</p>

<p>The transformation is one of the most encouraging things to see as an artist myself, because it humbles you and reminds you that Rome was not built in a day and needed perseverance and that an artist needs to learn and actually maintain their craft.</p><br /><a href='http://www.darcomic.com/'>A Super Girly Top Secret Comic Diary</a>
