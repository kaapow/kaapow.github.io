Being raised in Greece, I obviously have an affinity to the place. Varoufakis has been an interesting voice to hear/read these last few years. [This interview](https://www.wikitribune.com/story/2018/08/15/current-affairs/qa-with-yannis-varoufakis/84049/) with WikiTribune (the 1st Iâ€™ve read) offers an interesting perspective on the whole situation.
