Over the years I have bought a slew of Apple related products (for both myself and my wife). We are an Apple family.

1. **iPod Mini**  
_2nd Generation, Silver_. Won in a coaster competition at the time.
2. **Mac Mini**  
_mid-2007, 1.83GHz Intel Core 2 Duo/80GB HD/1GB DDR2 SDRAM)_  
3. **Mighty Mouse**
4. **Apple Wireless Keyboard**
5. **iPod Shuffle**  
_2nd Generation, Light Blue and Dark Blue versions._ Hey it was London, I was in my 20s. I lost the first one.
6. **iPod Shuffle**  
_3rd Generation, Black_. Rubbish version. Apple being to clever for it's own good.  
7. **Macbook**  
_13 inch, Aluminium, late 2008_. Still going strong 5 years later. A few dents but apart from that rock solid.  
8. **iPhone 4**  
_Black, 16GB_. My first iPhone.
9. **Time Capsule**  
_3rd Generation, Late 2009_  
10. **Macbook Pro**

11. **iPhone 5c**  
_Green, 16GB_  
12. **iPhone 6**  
_Spacegray, 64GB_. My second iPhone. Totally destroyed this phone. Been using a case ever since.  
13. **iPad Air**  
_White, 64GB_. My wife's iPad. She's wreched this bad boy 4 years into it's life.  
14. **iPhone 6s**  
_Spacegray, 128GB_. Replaced by Apple as they screwed up a screen replacement for my iPhone 6.
15. **iPhone 7**
