Over the years I have bought a slew of Apple related products (for both myself and my wife). We are an Apple family.

1. **iPod Mini** _2nd Generation, Silver_. 
Won in a coaster competition at the time.
2. **Mac Mini** _mid-2007, 1.83GHz Intel Core 2 Duo/80GB HD/1GB DDR2 SDRAM)_  
My very first Mac.
3. **Mighty Mouse**
4. **Apple Wireless Keyboard**
5. **iPod Shuffle** _2nd Generation, Light Blue and Dark Blue versions._ 
Hey it was London, I was in my 20s. I lost the first one.
6. **iPod Shuffle**  _3rd Generation, Black_.  
Rubbish version. Apple being to clever for it's own good.  
7. **Macbook** _13 inch, Aluminium, late 2008_.  
Still going strong 5 years later. A few dents but apart from that rock solid.  
8. **iPhone 4**  _Black, 16GB_.  
My first iPhone.
9. **Time Capsule**  _3rd Generation, Late 2009_   
Still in constant use, nearly a decade on.
10. **Macbook Pro**  _Retina Display, 13inch, late 2013_   
My _current_ Mac. Still strong.
11. **iPhone 5c**  _Green, 16GB_   
Was working fine until a November 2018, when the wife smashed the screen. Her second in a single day.  
12. **iPhone 6**  _Spacegray, 64GB_  
My second iPhone. Totally destroyed this phone. Been using a case ever since.  
13. **iPad Air**  _White, 64GB_  
My wife's iPad. She's wreched this bad boy 4 years into it's life.  
14. **iPhone 6s**  _Spacegray, 128GB_   
Replaced by Apple as they screwed up a screen replacement for my iPhone 6.
15. **iPhone 7**  _Gold, 128GB_  
Wife smashed the screen on this twice.
16. **Apple TV**  
_32GB_
17. **Airport Express**
18. **iPad**  _9.7" 2018, 128GB_  
A replacement to her smashed iPad Air. Funnily enough, this is pretty much a like for like replacement.
