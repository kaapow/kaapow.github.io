<p>This week I learnt a very clear lesson in what appears to work on Tumblr.</p>

<p>I &lsquo;relaunched&rsquo; Broken Kode with an all new number 1 post, around 3 months ago. I decided to keep a razor sharp focus on Tesla news and engineering in general. The model I was trying to on Daring Fireball - not a terribly original idea admittedly but I thought that as time would go on the site would evolve or die based on its own success and failure.</p>

<p>In those 3 months I honestly saw extremely limited traction of people visiting the site, reblogging or liking a post. In fact a total of 3 people actually follow the site - hi guys, thanks for following. Then earlier this week I posted my first image. That single post has generated more action than the entire site has had in the 3 months since the relaunch.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an 'event&rsquo; that I can&rsquo;t ignore, as clearly I&rsquo;m not reaching the desired audience on Tumblr - which I know exists. What I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s me, not you. Tumblr knows what it is. The users know what they want out of Tumblr; I however thought that I could use the platform in a different way. The platform is clearly suited to a specific kind of content, one which isn&rsquo;t text heavy.</p>
