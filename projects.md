This page captures the projects I've worked on, across both my professional life and my _spare_ time. This list is not exhaustive, but it does show that I have limited output that I can call my very own.

## Engineering & Architecture 
Engineering and the built environment has been part of my daily life since 2001 when I started working. I've had the pleasure of working on some truly amazing projects, with some truly exceptional people. 

I've been a building services engineer for over 16 years now. As the years go by, it's oftentimes difficult to remember all the projects as they quickly stack up.

## Comics 
One of my oldest and longest passions has been reading and to a much lesser degree making comics. So far the output has been limited to two single projects that have made their way online. 

### [Coffee Beans](https://medium.com/cerebral-interviews/coffee-beans-f79f0472e59f)
_Coffee Beans_ is a 4 page short graphic story was created as part of the Observer/Comica/ Jonathan Cape ‘Short Graphic Story’ competition in 2009. Sadly the entry didn’t win, but I still like the story. This was my first full comic book story I’ve written and drawn.  

### [Moon Racket!](http://www.moonracket.com)
An all-ages comic strip about Corgan and Alfie who live on the Moon — eating cheese & making noise.

Over the course of creating this strip, I've written about the process:

## Design
My love for graphic design began several decades ago. One of my biggest playgrounds has been my website.
