I'm a Chartered Engineer living in Dubai and working for [Arup](http://www.arup.com) with my wife and two sons. We are an [Apple](https://www.kaa.bz/2018/02/07/apple.html) family and frankly like it that way.

This is my [thought space](https://om.co/2018/02/08/blogs-as-though-spaces/).  It's published on [Micro.blog](http://micro.blog). If you'd like to comment on anything I write about, the go create an account, I highly recommend it. The feed however gets reposted over on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/kaa_pow), which I check sporadically as well.

Head on over to my [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:kaa) for some linky goodness.

My text editor of choice is [iA Writer](http://ia.net/writer) (soon using across all platforms). Graphics are created in the Affinity suite of software. 

This site is typset in [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather) and [Archivo Narrow](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Archivo+Narrow).
