Everyone has a passion to keep them sane as they meander through life's routines. These are some of the projects that are occupying my mind, _now_.

1. **Secret project** that has completely taken over my imagination and all my _free_ time. It's combining everything that I know how to do in one place. Will be sharing some stuff as it starts coming together.
2. I've completely been swept with [Micro.blog](http://micro.blog) fever. It's reminded me of what was great about blogging 15 years ago, only now it's soo much better.
3. I _occasionaly_ make comics, although this is a side-side-passion. I'm not very good at it and it takes a **long** time to complete. Head on over to [Moon Racket!](http://www.moonracket.com) for my comic strip about two friends, a robot and a worm, who live on the moon. This year I plan on releasing a collection of the work I've done so far and move the site over from Medium to [Blot](http://blot.im).
4. [RMO](http://rmo.life) is where I’m documenting my thoughts and ideas on how to _reduce mental overhead_. This is a very large project that will likely take several years before there is enough there to be of value, but you have to start somewhere.
