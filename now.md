[RMO](http://rmo.life) is where I’m documenting my thoughts and ideas on how to _reduce mental overhead_. This is a very large project that will likely take several years before there is enough there to be of value, but you have to start somewhere.

I _occasionaly_ make comics, although this is a side-side-passion. I'm not very good at it and it takes a **long** time to complete. I'm currently _trying_ to work through Alphonso Dunn's book [Pen and Ink Drawing: A Simple Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Pen-Ink-Drawing-Simple-Guide/dp/0997046538), although I keep stopping and starting it. 

Head on over to [Moon Racket!](http://www.moonracket.com) for my comic strip about two friends, a robot and a worm, who live on the moon. This year I plan on releasing a collection of the work I've done so far.

I've completely been swept with [micro.blog](http://micro.blog) fever. It's reminded me of what was great about blogging 15 years ago, only now it's soo much better.
