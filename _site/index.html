<p>Unsurprisingly the most useful metric I‚Äôve found is sleep logging. When did I go to sleep? When did I wake up? How long was my deep sleep for - that‚Äôs the good kind of sleep right? Right?</p>

<p>Sleep or the lack of it definitely is what affects me the most throughout my day - I might eat more or less, I might have a headache or not.</p>

<p>The behaviour that I was hoping for the most influence is the amount of exercise I carry out. This is still an ongoing project as I need to carve the correct time in my schedule to do the exercise. <strong>Operation summer</strong> is going to try and finally get into shape.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hoping Iceland pull an equaliser against Nigeria, along with Mexico they‚Äôre my two favourite <em>underdog</em> teams.</li>
  <li>How the hell did Nigeria just score twice in 20 minutes? Where Argentina had no way in?</li>
  <li>VAR comes to their rescue‚Ä¶and he hoofs the penalty. What is going on with the penalties this World Cup?</li>
  <li>Argentina can actually make it through to the next round now, after their abysmal performance yesterday to Croatia.</li>
  <li>Both goals by Musa are some of the best <em>individual</em> performance goals I‚Äôve seen in the world cup. Didn‚Äôt think they had it in them to be honest.</li>
  <li>A great second half in this game, makes this group qualifying a fascinating one to watch.</li>
