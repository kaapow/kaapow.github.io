    <h1>My thoughts on Brexit</h1>
  
  <div class="e-content">
  <p>So I honestly didn’t think that the first series that I would be writing about is Brexit. I thought I’d be talking about something simple like waste in the house, energy efficiencies and creativity. No instead I get to delve into what happens after the referendum of 23rd of June, 2016.</p>

<p>Before we get to that, a little personal history is in order. I feel that it’s important for me to write some of my thoughts on Brexit and the referendum, <em>mainly</em> for myself, so that I can review in a few years time what it is that I was actually thinking, and <em>partly</em> for my son when he asks me in the future why Britain is not part of the European Union.</p>

<p>I grew up in Greece, which against all odds remains as part of the European Union. My formative years were lived in the UK (started my life in Nottingham before moving down like many to London). For the last 6 years I’ve lived outside the UK. That’s a long time and I’ve missed out on some truly amazing things. The referendum on the 23rd of June 2016 however has to be one of the most important things that I wasn’t really a part of. Something that will both affect my future and my son’s future.</p>

<p>The reason for my leaving the UK are generally that even being an Engineer working for one of the most respected consultancy firms in the world, life in the UK is built around the concept of at least two income per households — everything else is a bit of a struggle for survival or an incredibly miserable grind.</p>

<p>My single biggest issue with Brexit, apart from the fact that it’s an ill conceived reaction led by a bunch of buffoons with little to no understanding of the damage that it will do to millions of people, is the fact that overall it’s a clear sign of people and humanity moving in the <em>wrong</em> direction. Rather than being inclusive of each other, we are pushing each other away and building boundaries between us — whether artificial or real.</p>

<p>Frankly the whole situation has broken my heart and my spirit a little bit. Growing up in Athens, but with no European Citizenship, I know what it feels like to be out of the union. In a few years time, I will have this feeling all over again.</p>
