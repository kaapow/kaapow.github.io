    <h1>Micro.blog Initial Thoughts</h1>
  
  <div class="e-content">
  <p>Now that I’ve kicked the micro.blog tires for a few days, I can safely say a couple of things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I like the fact that this is a paid service. It means you have to get it and want to be involved in it to keep paying. The internet would be a different place if it didn’t make everything free.</li>
  <li>Loading the timeline is slow (on the site and certainly on iOS and the Mac). It perfectly usable but it doesn’t go unnoticed either. Not sure if this is something that <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> you have your eye on to improve in the future?</li>
  <li>Information isn’t located discusing the map for the development of the site (and therefore the core service). I understand that if something is good it will grow organically, but I would hope that there is a vision of where this connection is headed towards?</li>
  <li>Love being able to use Markdown in my posts.</li>
  <li>Shame no #hashtags. Not sure what the reasons for excluding it from the design were?</li>
  <li>Because it’s small everyone is talking to everyone else. The experience is only enhanced for the better because of it all.</li>
  <li>Love how it doesn’t matter how much or little you want to write, everything is welcome, it’s just displayed a little differently.</li>
  <li>I’d like to be able to edit my text from the site itself (as long as I’m logged in).</li>
  <li>I’d like to be able to download all my posts as single .md files, rather than a WordPress (???) export of some description. If not single .md files, then at least 1 single .md file. I’m currently using IFTTT to append my words to a text file via the RSS feed. The only problem my glorious Markdown is converted in the HTML.</li>
</ol>
