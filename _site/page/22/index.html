I’ll be getting into my overall setup at some point, but this is a decided shift from me as I have until now published only in black and white.</p>

<p>This is not a sign that <strong>I</strong> no longer believe in black &amp; white, but maybe rather the strip is better served on the internet with a splash of colour - I’ll report on whether that theory holds water after a few of these have gone out, but my feeling is that this small change will make a noticable difference.</p>

<p>As this is still the first one, like with most strips, there will be an evolution of the colour art as I get more comfortable with the process and try different ideas.The only downside, is that the <em>Moon Racket!</em> website will now have to be tweaked slightly to capture this colour palette (which is slightly different from previous iterations of colour that I’ve used in promo art).</p>

One of the things I’m currently working on is the coloured version of the characters.</p>

<p>One of the comments that’s been made to me is that the black and white version of the strip is holding back potential readers. Some just are not all that into <strong>glorious</strong> black &amp; white comic art - it feels, <em>unfinished</em>. This week’s strip will be an experiment to see whether or not that really is the case.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2015/07/01/bullet-points.html">6 Bullet Points</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been following the Greek situation with keen interest - being the country in which I grew up in, where my parents currently live and where my brother just this morning went to an interview for his citizenship.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been pretty interesting to see Yanis Varoufakis in action and read the words he&rsquo;s been posting over the last 6 months. He&rsquo;s chosen arguably the <em>worst</em> job in Greece at the moment but this latest 6 short bullet points is an interesting stake in the ground. His latest post <a href="http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2015/07/01/why-we-recommend-a-no-in-the-referendum-in-6-short-bullet-points/">Why we recommend a NO in the referendum – in 6 short bullet points</a> is an interesting idea to summarise their government&rsquo;s thoughts on the subject.</p>

<p>While everyone is saying that a NO vote would effectively mean that Europe ejects Greece out of the Eurozone, Varoufakis is claiming that this would not happen. Why it will not happen is still not clear to me however. From an interview (with a less the eloquent minister in Syriza) on the BBC earlier today, it appears that they think that European law excludes such a thing from happening. Honestly when the money and stakes are this high, I doubt new rules cannot be rewritten.</p>

<p>Sunday is only a few short days away and we&rsquo;ll see how the Greek people will vote.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2015/06/23/four-dials.html">Four Dials</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>Recently I&rsquo;ve started listening to the podcast <a href="http://hellointernet.fm">Hello Internet </a> - if you&rsquo;ve not had a chance i recommend you listen and actually try and stick through it as its a pretty good conversation between two interesting hosts.</p>

<p>Just finished episode 3 (although I&rsquo;ve also listened to a few of the later episodes, and then jumped back) but the concept of 4 dials or light bulbs in ones life was discussed. The concept stuck with me however what I realised is that actually my dials are different due to my physical location. So to recap the original four dials:</p>

<ul><li>Family</li>
<li>Work</li>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Friends</li>
</ul>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve realised is that while the first 3 items remain relevant in my life, the last one however has dropped effectively to 0%. In its place my <em>comic book</em> work has taken its place.</p>

<p>When we moved over to Doha the idea of starting fresh with no support network to start from was a daunting one. The truth is, we&rsquo;ve not actually really developed this support network in any way since we moved here 3 years ago. Apart from the guys in the office, I&rsquo;ve really not ventured very far in this realm. I try and maintain my connections with my friends, but seeing as they are far away, this was one aspect that I knew was going to take a hit. The concious decision was that we didn&rsquo;t expand that circle at all.</p>

<h3>By the Numbers</h3>

<p>This is effectively what my percentages look like at the moment:</p>

<ul><li>Family: 30%</li>
<li>Work: 50%</li>
<li>Health: 5%</li>
<li>Comics: 10%</li>
<li>Downtime: 5%</li>
</ul>
<p>Will I ever become a professional cartoonist? Not when I only am dedicating 10% of my energy to the task, it&rsquo;s really at best, a hobby, a simple side project. My job as an engineer isn&rsquo;t going away any time soon and my family time and health time are as low as I&rsquo;m going to go at the moment.</p>

<p>The only part that I could take away is the downtime (watching movies, television, surfing the internet, reading a book or magazine). Those things however are important to keep you sane.</p>

<p>The problem I have with this breakdown is that the reality of the situation is such that I am actually using that 10% and doing wonders with it. I&rsquo;ve been able to create multiple websites that I run quasi-regularly. I&rsquo;ve been able to create a web comic that I&rsquo;ve invested an incredible amount of time to write, draw and now publish. I do acknowledge however that this has been at the expense of other things, and that&rsquo;s fine for the moment, but it&rsquo;s not going to stay like that for very long.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2015/06/22/moon-racket-on.html">Moon Racket! on Medium</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>I’ve decided to use <a href="http://www.medium.com/@moonracket">Medium</a> as an additional platform from which I publish the new season of my comic, <em>Moon Racket!</em> Multiple factors coalesced to make this decision.</p>

<p>In the past I have used 3 different platforms to publish and distribute my comic strip:</p>

<ol><li>The official <a href="http://moonracket.com">website</a>, hosted on Tumblr</li>
<li>The <a href="http://tinyletter.com/moonracket">newsletter</a>, powered by Tinyletter</li>
<li>Tapastic (at least in the first season).</li>
</ol>
<p>Moving forward I’ll be publishing on Medium, <em>Moon Racket!</em> and through the newsletter. So what brought about this change? To answer that question, I think I should answer another question, how have the other platforms been faring?</p>

<p>The truth is that each of the above platforms provided very specific (detrimental) restrictions on the artwork itself, but also allowed for a potentially wider distribution. The problem is that this wider distribution never manifested itself in a meaningful way.</p>

<h3>Tumblr</h3>

<p>Moon Racket! is hosted on Tumblr, a platform usually suited for rectangular posts that fit within the stream that is present for eveyone. The restrictions on images are therefore made to suit their platform. The maximum size of image that can be posted is one that is 1200px wide. On a retina screen that’s the equivalent of a 600px image. The effect of this restriction is that my comic always appears blurry.</p>

<p>While this is a nitpick, for a perfectionist like myself, it’s a deal breaker.</p>

<h3>Newsletter</h3>

<p>If I thought that Tumblr provided restrictions, then I was in for a rude awakening with my newsletter experience. This one can only be typically shown in a 600px wide image, otherwise it will break most inboxes.</p>

<p>My experience with Tinyletter has been mixed. But ultimately my question for a beautiful experience was wrecked by that platform’s constraints. In mitigate I’ve moved things over to Mailchimp, which I’m hoping will offer better options and experience.</p>

<p>Even then, I’m still not showcasing the art in the best possible way.</p>

<h3>Tapastic</h3>

<p>This platform holds promise, but once again there are size restrictions to the images that can be uploaded. While the platform as a whole does allow for a plethora of things aimed at comic content creators, I don’t believe that I would be able to reap many (any?) of those benefits.</p>

<p>It’s also being lost in the sea that is being published there. Some of which is aimed at a very different audience.</p>

<hr />
<p>Which brings me to Medium.</p>

<p>The editor provided on Medium is without question the best editor on the internet, have tried a very large number of them.</p>

<p>The other instant win for Medium is how the platform chooses to deal with images. They’re not just first class citizens, they are allowed to exist in a manner that makes them shine. In fact the more I write about this, the more convinced I am of what an idiot I am for not considering this platform earlier.</p>

<p>The biggest question I have is whether I can connect with an audience for an all ages comic strip about a robot (Corgan) and his worm friend (Alfie) that live on the moon, that’s made of cheese on Medium.</p>

<p>That’s a journey I’m happy to take, because if nothing else I’ll take it in <strong>style</strong>.</p>

<p>I got a bunch of Shinhan Art pens last week. I was so excited to use them that this little image popped out in a matter of minutes. One of the most encouraging things about sticking with a bunch of characters is watching their evolution happen before your eyes. There is a confidence that I’m aware of and actually <em>really</em> enjoying experiencing at the moment. I just wish I could do this more regularly.</p>
