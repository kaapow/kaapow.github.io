		<h1><a href="/2018/02/13/welcome-to-rmo.html">Welcome to RMO</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>One of the fundamental challenges I faced towards the twilight years of my original stint of writing and publishing on the internet (that was nearly 10 years ago now) was the very fact that I didn’t have a singular focus. As my focus meandered, it became a challenge to continue writing meaningful words to capture those ideas with any regularity.</p>

<p>I remember trying very hard to find a focus, even started writing exclusively about Tesla, before I got bored of it all and annoyed people by cluttering up with Facebook feeds with re-posted articles I’d written. By trying to shoehorn myself and the little audience I had, I effectively lost the drive to continue.</p>

<p>This time it’s different. Very different. There are several reasons for this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>To provide me with a location to collect all my thoughts on the subject of <em>reducing mental overhead</em>.</li>
  <li>To provide everyone else with a resource that might help them achieve something important in their life.</li>
  <li>I’m now clear that I don’t care to heavily about what the site looks like. Thankfully <a href="http://blot.im">Blot</a> (and David) have me completely covered in one of the best hidden secrets on the internet.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the last year and a half, I’ve been working in the background on capturing these thoughts and putting them into a coherent document. At the time I thought that the best way to get the ball rolling would have been to buy a domain name that I liked and then start a website — no matter how crude. This was the first version:</p>

<p><img src="http://rmo.life/_images/RMO_V1_Screenshot.png" alt="RMO Version 1" /></p>

<p>It didn’t work. It sat there, unloved, for an entire year, which is just as well. Last year was by all accounts a tough year for me, but this allowed the idea to bounce around in my head. To learn about Stoicism, to regroup and rebalance my thoughts on these ideas that started back in 2016. Sometimes time and space are an essential partner for letting thoughts mature.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/02/09/microblogging-initial-thoughts.html">Micro.blog Initial Thoughts</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>Now that I’ve kicked the micro.blog tires for a few days, I can safely say a couple of things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I like the fact that this is a paid service. It means you have to get it and want to be involved in it to keep paying. The internet would be a different place if it didn’t make everything free.</li>
  <li>Loading the timeline is slow (on the site and certainly on iOS and the Mac). It perfectly usable but it doesn’t go unnoticed either. Not sure if this is something that <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> you have your eye on to improve in the future?</li>
  <li>Information isn’t located discusing the map for the development of the site (and therefore the core service). I understand that if something is good it will grow organically, but I would hope that there is a vision of where this connection is headed towards?</li>
  <li>Love being able to use Markdown in my posts.</li>
  <li>Shame no #hashtags. Not sure what the reasons for excluding it from the design were?</li>
  <li>Because it’s small everyone is talking to everyone else. The experience is only enhanced for the better because of it all.</li>
  <li>Love how it doesn’t matter how much or little you want to write, everything is welcome, it’s just displayed a little differently.</li>
  <li>I’d like to be able to edit my text from the site itself (as long as I’m logged in).</li>
  <li>I’d like to be able to download all my posts as single .md files, rather than a WordPress (???) export of some description. If not single .md files, then at least 1 single .md file. I’m currently using IFTTT to append my words to a text file via the RSS feed. The only problem my glorious Markdown is converted in the HTML.</li>

      <div class="e-content"><p>It’s been a super interesting week for my internet life. After pulling away from it all for a significant amount of time, I now believe I’ve found the necessary tools to get something out of it. This micro.blog is my therapy of sorts (some of the more deeply personal stuff is bound to stay hidden somewhere in my journal), and <a href="http://rmo.life">RMO</a> is pretty much my ideal setup for writing and editing long form (mainly due to the control the app affords me over the layout).</p>

<p>So for now my internet output is really split across 3 main locations, each with very specific goals:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://kaa.micro.blog">kaa.micro.blog</a> - Digital Drawer</li>
  <li><a href="http://rmo.life">rmo.life</a> - Capturing all things related to RMO</li>
  <li><a href="https://pinboard.in/u:kaa">pinboard.in/u:kaa</a> - Links you should remember</li>

<p>Everything else can either be syndicated or deleted when the time is right.</p>
