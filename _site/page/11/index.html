		<h1><a href="/2016/06/25/starts.html">Starts</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>You have to start somewhere. Creativity is borne oftentimes of <strong>constraint</strong>. While this is something that has been talked about, finding your own constraints is actually much harder to do in practice.</p>

<p>I’ve always wanted to maintain a voice on the internet. Back in 2004, blogging and the community that surrounded that activity on the internet was an extremely exciting and vibrant. I desperately wanted to be a part of what was happening. The problem was that after I exhausted the initial ideas (which to be fair took years to exhaust) I didn’t really find my voice. The options available to me were limitless…and that was the problem.</p>

<h2>What’s in a name</h2>

<p>This isn’t the first time I’ve used the term <em>Cerebral Interviews</em>. In my first website, from back in 2004, it was the very first category or tag that I used to describe the general noise that was flowing in my head.</p>

<p>I then tried to use that same term for a newsletter that I ran for a year. The newsletter had a bunch of links and commentary that would be published once a month. It was mainly sent through to my friends and family and received approximately 0% engagement from anyone on the list. Hardly a roaring success but it allowed me to get somethings off my chest.</p>

<p>What I’ve realised is that actually although I love design in general, it distracts me from the actual creative work. I will miss the fun that I’ve had learning HTML/CSS/PHP (I could never wrap my head around Javascript for some reason), but I need to add enough constraints that will allow me to produce more regularly.</p>

<p>Design can now be constrained to the images and stuff that surround the work that I publish, rather than the vessel in which they’re delivered to. Medium has my back.</p>

<h2>The Product</h2>

<p>Which brings me to the actual content at hand. What’s the point of my existing online. Why not limit my output to links and commentary on my Twitter and Instagram accounts? There’s also all the work that goes into producing <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket!</a>?</p>

<p>Twitter doesn’t allow me to craft an article, or publish comics with the inherent presentation that is available at my fingertips on <em>Medium</em>. Having a platform ready to go will allow me to concentrate on the task at hand and actually just finish pages and publish them is an important one for me.</p>

<p>By publishing here, the amount of fiddling available to me is constrained and that will hopefully help me to focus on the final products.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2016/05/02/giving-up.html">Giving Up</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>I’m not sure when it happened exactly, but somewhere along the way, I just gave up creating and giving a shit about <em>creating</em> for the internet. I gave up following comic books in a semi-religious manner. I gave up playing basketball every single week. I gave up watching movies regularly. I gave up writing to my various website.</p>

<p>My aim has always been to create a <em>small</em> library of stories that I’ve written and drawn that are available in a multitude of formats (from digital to paperbacks and hardcovers). It’s a reasonably modest aim, but with the option of becoming greater depending on scale.</p>

<p>Do I think that this library of stories will provide me with a living? Probably not, unless I have some serious success somewhere and hit on the zeitgeist in a way that I can neither predict nor anticipate. So I’ll be content to having a series of books with my name on the spine and that finally put to paper the ideas in my head.</p>

<h2>Little strokes fell great oaks</h2>

<p>I’m clear that for the time being I will not have hours and hours to my name. I can however carve 30 minutes in the morning and 30 minutes in the evening and effectively do 2 pomodoros. High burst sets of 30 minutes pieces of work. That’s 7 hours a week. That’s 364 hours a year. If I spend 10 hours per page that equates to 36.4 pages of story and art. If I manage to do a page of art a week, then I’ll be able to do around 50 pages a year. The size of a European album.</p>

<p>The numbers don’t lie. It all starts with 2 pomodoros every single day. The issue however is life getting in the way. Sometimes you’re extremely tired. Sometimes the boy doesn’t sleep. Sometimes I have a business trip or I’m not feeling up for it. This is only natural. The difficulty is finding a way to get back into the routine. Routines are hard won and easily lost.</p>

<h2>Deadlines</h2>

<p>The last piece of the puzzle. I have about 8 projects that are not really linked with each other floating at different stages of development. I need to stop the <a href="http://elitedaily.com/money/entrepreneurship/addicted-ideas-give-brain-crack-go/">braincrack</a> from spreading and destroying my flow.</p>

<p>So I’ll be dedicating 1 year to any of these projects. That gives them enough time to mature. Of course if I’m close to finishing any of the projects then I’ll continue till I finish, but if I’m completely off, then that one gets parked and I move onto the next one.</p>

<p>So as a way to keep track, 2015 was mainly <a href="http://moonracket.com">Moon Racket!</a> and will extend to the end of 2016. After 2016, I will stop work on this series (unless it’s exploded) and then move onto the next project.</p>

<p>This all begins tomorrow morning - I’ll be back regularly to discuss progress.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2015/12/20/024709.html">2016</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>5 months. That’s a really long time between updates. The truth is that I was creating things until at least the very end of september, it just so happened that I wasn’t really in the mood to talk about them.</p>

<p>The main reason for the radio silence over the autumn and start of winter is down to the fact that I’m relocating to Dubai. That’s been a huge drain on all of my ‘free’ time and drawing and creating has been relegated to the <em>too difficult to deal with</em> drawer.</p>

<p>I have decided to take this time to reflect on what I want to do with my creative output once things have settled down a little bit more.</p>

<h2>Moon Racket!</h2>

<p>I’ve got 10-15 new strips of <a href="http://moonracket.com">Moon Racket!</a> to publish and then I’d like to stick to the routine of publishing something new to <em>Moon Racket!</em> at least once a week for the entire year of 2016.  Obviously I’ll likely fail, but I want to at least <strong>try.</strong></p>

<p>The main focus moving forward will be to improve the strip with actual backgrounds. I’m painfully aware at the general lack of backgrounds and environment that is missing (or at least that could be better defined than right now).</p>

<p>However I won’t be publishing 4 panel strips. It’s not how my brain works. Rather I’ll be writing stories that will take up several panels, maybe entire pages with these characters in them. I have the first story roughed out, so just need to get cracking.</p>

<h2>Chroma</h2>

<p>The real push in 2016 will be for me to finally draw and start publishing <em>Chroma</em>. This is a very long time coming and I feel that if I don’t do it now, I’ll likely never do it. After multiple attempts at starting this project, I’m now of the mind that it’s better to get it out there, in whatever form it comes, rather than trying to get it perfect from day one. It will never be that so I should stop worrying about it.</p>

<h2>Creative Output</h2>

<p>If I’m able to publish 1 page a month of <em>Chroma</em>  and the weekly <em>Moon Racket!</em> page, then 2016 is likely going to be a MONSTER year . I’m fully aware that this is an ambitious programme for me (considering what goes into moving to a city like Dubai), but this is work that I’ll be carrying out first thing in the morning. The intention is to carry out 1-2 hours of creative output a day, <em>every</em> day, <em>every</em> morning.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2015/10/30/adventure-in-stationary.html">Adventure in Stationary</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>For years I&rsquo;ve been exceptionally content with my choice of pen, the Muji 0.38mm gel ink pen, in <strong>black</strong>. The main issue with the pen was the cheap plastic enclosure that held that wonderful refill. I grew exceptionally bored of it and I was willing to splurge some money on something that was better.</p>

<p>Previously I&rsquo;d splash money on stationary related to my artwork, but never for my work related stationary. My hunt for a better enclosure made me look at all of my stationary in a decidedly different way and led me down a rabbit hole that I am yet to emerge from (listened to all the episodes of the <a href="http://www.relay.fm/penaddict">Pen Addict podcast</a>). Thankfully the situation is a lot more under control than when I first started on this journey. After a year of buying a wide range of pens, I now know pretty much what will appeal to me and will fit into my rotation pretty much instantly.</p>

<p>I intend to go into a decent amount of detail but rather than writing everything in one single shot, I&rsquo;ll highlight the main takes for now:</p>

<ol><li>I&rsquo;m likely not going to be expanding my fountain pen collection past a <a href="http://www.pelikan.com/pulse/Pulsar/en_US_INTL.FWI.displayShop.106959./classic-205-black-silver">Pelikan M205</a> in the future. It stops here at my <a href="http://www.sailorpen.com/professional-gear.html">Sailor Pro Gear Slim</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.midori-japan.co.jp/md/en/products/notebook.html">Midori MDs</a> are the only choice of sketch notebooks that I will likely ever use. These are perfect. The A4 version is next on my list.</li>
<li>Nothing beats my <a href="http://www.muji.eu/pages/online.asp?Sec=13&amp;Sub=52">Muji 0.38mm pen</a> for quick sketching and inking - the <em>Pilot Juice</em> pens come in a close second. I&rsquo;ve still to find my ideal holder - the original Takumi pen was a massive disappointment, hopefully version 2 goes in a better direction. Might have to design one myself.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve enjoyed using my <a href="http://www.1101.com/store/techo/2016/planner/index.html">Hobonichi Techo</a> (although not as often as I would want to and not with the type of content I was hoping for) - will be trying out an A5 version this year., maybe that format suits me better?</li>
<li>I will be getting a Nanami <a href="http://www.nanamipaper.com/products/copy-of-seven-seas-standard-a5-blank-journal.html">Seven Seas Standard</a> notebook in the future as well.</li>
<li>The Penxo is one of the best conceived and delivered Kickstarters that I&rsquo;ve ever used - even though they fucked up my order and gave me the wrong leads.</li>
<li>I will be getting a <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/colors/">Field Notes</a> subscription in November. I like the fun of seeing what these guys come up with and have been enjoying collecting these notebooks.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve still not found my ideal EDC pen. I still have time to back the <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/buy/karas-kustoms-edk">EDK</a>, but not sure if that&rsquo;s the one for me.</li>

		<h1><a href="/2015/08/22/gallery-its-been.html">Hobonichi Techo 2016</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>It’s been a year already? The latest lineup for the Hobonichi Techo 2016 (in Japanese for now) is <a href="http://www.1101.com/store/techo/">online</a>. Unlike last year, where I was completely taken by the buzz and the excitement of something new, I now know what to expect and more crucially what I like and need.</p>

<p>The A6 size hasn’t worked out for me as I would have liked. I found myself running out of space on occasions, or ended up looking to complete my thoughts elsewhere. That’s going to have to change if I’m going to use this book as my catchall for everything. I am a huge lover of the A5 size, and while the ‘Cousin’ version of the Hobonichi planner is in fact all in Japanese, it’s functional enough to not be a problem.</p>

<p>The biggest draw for this notebook is the paper, which is without equal. I’ve tried many different papers this year, but the Tomoe River paper has stood out as the undeputed champion when it comes to making the most out of inks and pens that I use.</p>

<p>The Hobonichi Techo will remain my notebook of choice, where I dump all my thoughts and ideas into a single place. The only bad thing is that I now need a new cover - the new ones are a big disappointment, so I’m looking to Etsy for some alternatives. Top of my list are these covers from <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/241142080/a5-burgundy-leather-notebook-journal?ref=shop_home_feat_4">StrideRidge</a> - and they’re actually affordable unlike some of these ‘official’ covers on offer.</p>

I’ll be getting into my overall setup at some point, but this is a decided shift from me as I have until now published only in black and white.</p>

<p>This is not a sign that <strong>I</strong> no longer believe in black &amp; white, but maybe rather the strip is better served on the internet with a splash of colour - I’ll report on whether that theory holds water after a few of these have gone out, but my feeling is that this small change will make a noticable difference.</p>

<p>As this is still the first one, like with most strips, there will be an evolution of the colour art as I get more comfortable with the process and try different ideas.The only downside, is that the <em>Moon Racket!</em> website will now have to be tweaked slightly to capture this colour palette (which is slightly different from previous iterations of colour that I’ve used in promo art).</p>

One of the things I’m currently working on is the coloured version of the characters.</p>

<p>One of the comments that’s been made to me is that the black and white version of the strip is holding back potential readers. Some just are not all that into <strong>glorious</strong> black &amp; white comic art - it feels, <em>unfinished</em>. This week’s strip will be an experiment to see whether or not that really is the case.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2015/07/01/bullet-points.html">6 Bullet Points</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been following the Greek situation with keen interest - being the country in which I grew up in, where my parents currently live and where my brother just this morning went to an interview for his citizenship.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been pretty interesting to see Yanis Varoufakis in action and read the words he&rsquo;s been posting over the last 6 months. He&rsquo;s chosen arguably the <em>worst</em> job in Greece at the moment but this latest 6 short bullet points is an interesting stake in the ground. His latest post <a href="http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2015/07/01/why-we-recommend-a-no-in-the-referendum-in-6-short-bullet-points/">Why we recommend a NO in the referendum – in 6 short bullet points</a> is an interesting idea to summarise their government&rsquo;s thoughts on the subject.</p>

<p>While everyone is saying that a NO vote would effectively mean that Europe ejects Greece out of the Eurozone, Varoufakis is claiming that this would not happen. Why it will not happen is still not clear to me however. From an interview (with a less the eloquent minister in Syriza) on the BBC earlier today, it appears that they think that European law excludes such a thing from happening. Honestly when the money and stakes are this high, I doubt new rules cannot be rewritten.</p>

<p>Sunday is only a few short days away and we&rsquo;ll see how the Greek people will vote.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2015/06/23/four-dials.html">Four Dials</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>Recently I&rsquo;ve started listening to the podcast <a href="http://hellointernet.fm">Hello Internet </a> - if you&rsquo;ve not had a chance i recommend you listen and actually try and stick through it as its a pretty good conversation between two interesting hosts.</p>

<p>Just finished episode 3 (although I&rsquo;ve also listened to a few of the later episodes, and then jumped back) but the concept of 4 dials or light bulbs in ones life was discussed. The concept stuck with me however what I realised is that actually my dials are different due to my physical location. So to recap the original four dials:</p>

<ul><li>Family</li>
<li>Work</li>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Friends</li>
</ul>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve realised is that while the first 3 items remain relevant in my life, the last one however has dropped effectively to 0%. In its place my <em>comic book</em> work has taken its place.</p>

<p>When we moved over to Doha the idea of starting fresh with no support network to start from was a daunting one. The truth is, we&rsquo;ve not actually really developed this support network in any way since we moved here 3 years ago. Apart from the guys in the office, I&rsquo;ve really not ventured very far in this realm. I try and maintain my connections with my friends, but seeing as they are far away, this was one aspect that I knew was going to take a hit. The concious decision was that we didn&rsquo;t expand that circle at all.</p>

<h3>By the Numbers</h3>

<p>This is effectively what my percentages look like at the moment:</p>

<ul><li>Family: 30%</li>
<li>Work: 50%</li>
<li>Health: 5%</li>
<li>Comics: 10%</li>
<li>Downtime: 5%</li>
</ul>
<p>Will I ever become a professional cartoonist? Not when I only am dedicating 10% of my energy to the task, it&rsquo;s really at best, a hobby, a simple side project. My job as an engineer isn&rsquo;t going away any time soon and my family time and health time are as low as I&rsquo;m going to go at the moment.</p>

<p>The only part that I could take away is the downtime (watching movies, television, surfing the internet, reading a book or magazine). Those things however are important to keep you sane.</p>

<p>The problem I have with this breakdown is that the reality of the situation is such that I am actually using that 10% and doing wonders with it. I&rsquo;ve been able to create multiple websites that I run quasi-regularly. I&rsquo;ve been able to create a web comic that I&rsquo;ve invested an incredible amount of time to write, draw and now publish. I do acknowledge however that this has been at the expense of other things, and that&rsquo;s fine for the moment, but it&rsquo;s not going to stay like that for very long.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2015/06/22/moon-racket-on.html">Moon Racket! on Medium</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>I’ve decided to use <a href="http://www.medium.com/@moonracket">Medium</a> as an additional platform from which I publish the new season of my comic, <em>Moon Racket!</em> Multiple factors coalesced to make this decision.</p>

<p>In the past I have used 3 different platforms to publish and distribute my comic strip:</p>

<ol><li>The official <a href="http://moonracket.com">website</a>, hosted on Tumblr</li>
<li>The <a href="http://tinyletter.com/moonracket">newsletter</a>, powered by Tinyletter</li>
<li>Tapastic (at least in the first season).</li>
</ol>
<p>Moving forward I’ll be publishing on Medium, <em>Moon Racket!</em> and through the newsletter. So what brought about this change? To answer that question, I think I should answer another question, how have the other platforms been faring?</p>

<p>The truth is that each of the above platforms provided very specific (detrimental) restrictions on the artwork itself, but also allowed for a potentially wider distribution. The problem is that this wider distribution never manifested itself in a meaningful way.</p>

<h3>Tumblr</h3>

<p>Moon Racket! is hosted on Tumblr, a platform usually suited for rectangular posts that fit within the stream that is present for eveyone. The restrictions on images are therefore made to suit their platform. The maximum size of image that can be posted is one that is 1200px wide. On a retina screen that’s the equivalent of a 600px image. The effect of this restriction is that my comic always appears blurry.</p>

<p>While this is a nitpick, for a perfectionist like myself, it’s a deal breaker.</p>

<h3>Newsletter</h3>

<p>If I thought that Tumblr provided restrictions, then I was in for a rude awakening with my newsletter experience. This one can only be typically shown in a 600px wide image, otherwise it will break most inboxes.</p>

<p>My experience with Tinyletter has been mixed. But ultimately my question for a beautiful experience was wrecked by that platform’s constraints. In mitigate I’ve moved things over to Mailchimp, which I’m hoping will offer better options and experience.</p>

<p>Even then, I’m still not showcasing the art in the best possible way.</p>

<h3>Tapastic</h3>

<p>This platform holds promise, but once again there are size restrictions to the images that can be uploaded. While the platform as a whole does allow for a plethora of things aimed at comic content creators, I don’t believe that I would be able to reap many (any?) of those benefits.</p>

<p>It’s also being lost in the sea that is being published there. Some of which is aimed at a very different audience.</p>

<hr />
<p>Which brings me to Medium.</p>

<p>The editor provided on Medium is without question the best editor on the internet, have tried a very large number of them.</p>

<p>The other instant win for Medium is how the platform chooses to deal with images. They’re not just first class citizens, they are allowed to exist in a manner that makes them shine. In fact the more I write about this, the more convinced I am of what an idiot I am for not considering this platform earlier.</p>

<p>The biggest question I have is whether I can connect with an audience for an all ages comic strip about a robot (Corgan) and his worm friend (Alfie) that live on the moon, that’s made of cheese on Medium.</p>

<p>That’s a journey I’m happy to take, because if nothing else I’ll take it in <strong>style</strong>.</p>

<p>I got a bunch of Shinhan Art pens last week. I was so excited to use them that this little image popped out in a matter of minutes. One of the most encouraging things about sticking with a bunch of characters is watching their evolution happen before your eyes. There is a confidence that I’m aware of and actually <em>really</em> enjoying experiencing at the moment. I just wish I could do this more regularly.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2015/06/09/gallery-moon-racket.html">Moon Racket Website Update</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>Ever since I ‘relaunched’ the <em>Moon Racket!</em> <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">website</a> I’ve not been particularly happy with the footer. I always knew that it would have to change. My initial use of the footer was to effectively send people to different parts of the net that related to all things <em>Moon Racket!</em> - the <a href="http://www.twitter.com/moonracket">Twitter</a> account, the facebook account, the <a href="http://www.tinyletter.com/moonracket">newsletter</a> and this <a href="http://www.procssr.tumblr.com">process blog</a>. All of these links have now moved to the very top of the website, in a nice menu bar, that’s out of the way, but fully accessible if needed.</p>

<p>I received some negative feedback, when I publishing the first season, that sticks in my mind. It was from a woman that didn’t really understand what was going on in the series. On reflection I totally get that. At the time I couldn’t do anything about it, as the stories and art had been created. I knew I had to do better with the second series.</p>

<p>In an attempt to make the series more accessible, the stories have been written to not be as presumtive, but also the website should be first time reader friendly. To address these two issues, I’ve decided to use the footer as a <strong>What You Need to Know</strong> section, complete with character head shots and names, using those sketches from the <a href="http://procssr.tumblr.com/post/120693390813/from-the-desk-1-first-in-the-series-a-set-of">previous post</a>.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p><em>Routine</em> is everything when you&rsquo;re trying to develop and build something. To aid the routine from happening and not being taken off the rails, <em>constraints</em> are typically added into the mix.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago I decided to publish something new every weekday on this here process site. While I definitely don&rsquo;t want to go <em>meta</em> (and blog about blogging), I thought it was important to note that I&rsquo;ve come up with a way to help guide me through this publishing schedule. Each week I&rsquo;ll aim to publish a post in one of these categories:</p>

<ol><li>Marketing</li>
<li>Design</li>
<li>Character Development</li>
<li>From my Desk</li>
<li>Tools of the Trade</li>
</ol>
<p>The reason for publishing is that it focuses my mind to <strong>always be creating</strong>. It&rsquo;s also a great way to help me work things out. Publishing something online is somehow more concrete that writing a bunch of words either in notebooks or in random text files that live in my Dropbox folder.</p>
