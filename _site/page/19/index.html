		<h1><a href="/2015/10/30/adventure-in-stationary.html">Adventure in Stationary</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>For years I&rsquo;ve been exceptionally content with my choice of pen, the Muji 0.38mm gel ink pen, in <strong>black</strong>. The main issue with the pen was the cheap plastic enclosure that held that wonderful refill. I grew exceptionally bored of it and I was willing to splurge some money on something that was better.</p>

<p>Previously I&rsquo;d splash money on stationary related to my artwork, but never for my work related stationary. My hunt for a better enclosure made me look at all of my stationary in a decidedly different way and led me down a rabbit hole that I am yet to emerge from (listened to all the episodes of the <a href="http://www.relay.fm/penaddict">Pen Addict podcast</a>). Thankfully the situation is a lot more under control than when I first started on this journey. After a year of buying a wide range of pens, I now know pretty much what will appeal to me and will fit into my rotation pretty much instantly.</p>

<p>I intend to go into a decent amount of detail but rather than writing everything in one single shot, I&rsquo;ll highlight the main takes for now:</p>

<ol><li>I&rsquo;m likely not going to be expanding my fountain pen collection past a <a href="http://www.pelikan.com/pulse/Pulsar/en_US_INTL.FWI.displayShop.106959./classic-205-black-silver">Pelikan M205</a> in the future. It stops here at my <a href="http://www.sailorpen.com/professional-gear.html">Sailor Pro Gear Slim</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.midori-japan.co.jp/md/en/products/notebook.html">Midori MDs</a> are the only choice of sketch notebooks that I will likely ever use. These are perfect. The A4 version is next on my list.</li>
<li>Nothing beats my <a href="http://www.muji.eu/pages/online.asp?Sec=13&amp;Sub=52">Muji 0.38mm pen</a> for quick sketching and inking - the <em>Pilot Juice</em> pens come in a close second. I&rsquo;ve still to find my ideal holder - the original Takumi pen was a massive disappointment, hopefully version 2 goes in a better direction. Might have to design one myself.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve enjoyed using my <a href="http://www.1101.com/store/techo/2016/planner/index.html">Hobonichi Techo</a> (although not as often as I would want to and not with the type of content I was hoping for) - will be trying out an A5 version this year., maybe that format suits me better?</li>
<li>I will be getting a Nanami <a href="http://www.nanamipaper.com/products/copy-of-seven-seas-standard-a5-blank-journal.html">Seven Seas Standard</a> notebook in the future as well.</li>
<li>The Penxo is one of the best conceived and delivered Kickstarters that I&rsquo;ve ever used - even though they fucked up my order and gave me the wrong leads.</li>
<li>I will be getting a <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/colors/">Field Notes</a> subscription in November. I like the fun of seeing what these guys come up with and have been enjoying collecting these notebooks.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve still not found my ideal EDC pen. I still have time to back the <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/buy/karas-kustoms-edk">EDK</a>, but not sure if that&rsquo;s the one for me.</li>

		<h1><a href="/2015/08/22/gallery-its-been.html">Hobonichi Techo 2016</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>It’s been a year already? The latest lineup for the Hobonichi Techo 2016 (in Japanese for now) is <a href="http://www.1101.com/store/techo/">online</a>. Unlike last year, where I was completely taken by the buzz and the excitement of something new, I now know what to expect and more crucially what I like and need.</p>

<p>The A6 size hasn’t worked out for me as I would have liked. I found myself running out of space on occasions, or ended up looking to complete my thoughts elsewhere. That’s going to have to change if I’m going to use this book as my catchall for everything. I am a huge lover of the A5 size, and while the ‘Cousin’ version of the Hobonichi planner is in fact all in Japanese, it’s functional enough to not be a problem.</p>

<p>The biggest draw for this notebook is the paper, which is without equal. I’ve tried many different papers this year, but the Tomoe River paper has stood out as the undeputed champion when it comes to making the most out of inks and pens that I use.</p>

<p>The Hobonichi Techo will remain my notebook of choice, where I dump all my thoughts and ideas into a single place. The only bad thing is that I now need a new cover - the new ones are a big disappointment, so I’m looking to Etsy for some alternatives. Top of my list are these covers from <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/241142080/a5-burgundy-leather-notebook-journal?ref=shop_home_feat_4">StrideRidge</a> - and they’re actually affordable unlike some of these ‘official’ covers on offer.</p>

I’ll be getting into my overall setup at some point, but this is a decided shift from me as I have until now published only in black and white.</p>

<p>This is not a sign that <strong>I</strong> no longer believe in black &amp; white, but maybe rather the strip is better served on the internet with a splash of colour - I’ll report on whether that theory holds water after a few of these have gone out, but my feeling is that this small change will make a noticable difference.</p>

<p>As this is still the first one, like with most strips, there will be an evolution of the colour art as I get more comfortable with the process and try different ideas.The only downside, is that the <em>Moon Racket!</em> website will now have to be tweaked slightly to capture this colour palette (which is slightly different from previous iterations of colour that I’ve used in promo art).</p>

One of the things I’m currently working on is the coloured version of the characters.</p>

<p>One of the comments that’s been made to me is that the black and white version of the strip is holding back potential readers. Some just are not all that into <strong>glorious</strong> black &amp; white comic art - it feels, <em>unfinished</em>. This week’s strip will be an experiment to see whether or not that really is the case.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2015/07/01/bullet-points.html">6 Bullet Points</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been following the Greek situation with keen interest - being the country in which I grew up in, where my parents currently live and where my brother just this morning went to an interview for his citizenship.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been pretty interesting to see Yanis Varoufakis in action and read the words he&rsquo;s been posting over the last 6 months. He&rsquo;s chosen arguably the <em>worst</em> job in Greece at the moment but this latest 6 short bullet points is an interesting stake in the ground. His latest post <a href="http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2015/07/01/why-we-recommend-a-no-in-the-referendum-in-6-short-bullet-points/">Why we recommend a NO in the referendum – in 6 short bullet points</a> is an interesting idea to summarise their government&rsquo;s thoughts on the subject.</p>

<p>While everyone is saying that a NO vote would effectively mean that Europe ejects Greece out of the Eurozone, Varoufakis is claiming that this would not happen. Why it will not happen is still not clear to me however. From an interview (with a less the eloquent minister in Syriza) on the BBC earlier today, it appears that they think that European law excludes such a thing from happening. Honestly when the money and stakes are this high, I doubt new rules cannot be rewritten.</p>

<p>Sunday is only a few short days away and we&rsquo;ll see how the Greek people will vote.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>Recently I&rsquo;ve started listening to the podcast <a href="http://hellointernet.fm">Hello Internet </a> - if you&rsquo;ve not had a chance i recommend you listen and actually try and stick through it as its a pretty good conversation between two interesting hosts.</p>

<p>Just finished episode 3 (although I&rsquo;ve also listened to a few of the later episodes, and then jumped back) but the concept of 4 dials or light bulbs in ones life was discussed. The concept stuck with me however what I realised is that actually my dials are different due to my physical location. So to recap the original four dials:</p>

<ul><li>Family</li>
<li>Work</li>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Friends</li>
</ul>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve realised is that while the first 3 items remain relevant in my life, the last one however has dropped effectively to 0%. In its place my <em>comic book</em> work has taken its place.</p>

<p>When we moved over to Doha the idea of starting fresh with no support network to start from was a daunting one. The truth is, we&rsquo;ve not actually really developed this support network in any way since we moved here 3 years ago. Apart from the guys in the office, I&rsquo;ve really not ventured very far in this realm. I try and maintain my connections with my friends, but seeing as they are far away, this was one aspect that I knew was going to take a hit. The concious decision was that we didn&rsquo;t expand that circle at all.</p>

<h3>By the Numbers</h3>

<p>This is effectively what my percentages look like at the moment:</p>

<ul><li>Family: 30%</li>
<li>Work: 50%</li>
<li>Health: 5%</li>
<li>Comics: 10%</li>
<li>Downtime: 5%</li>
</ul>
<p>Will I ever become a professional cartoonist? Not when I only am dedicating 10% of my energy to the task, it&rsquo;s really at best, a hobby, a simple side project. My job as an engineer isn&rsquo;t going away any time soon and my family time and health time are as low as I&rsquo;m going to go at the moment.</p>

<p>The only part that I could take away is the downtime (watching movies, television, surfing the internet, reading a book or magazine). Those things however are important to keep you sane.</p>

<p>The problem I have with this breakdown is that the reality of the situation is such that I am actually using that 10% and doing wonders with it. I&rsquo;ve been able to create multiple websites that I run quasi-regularly. I&rsquo;ve been able to create a web comic that I&rsquo;ve invested an incredible amount of time to write, draw and now publish. I do acknowledge however that this has been at the expense of other things, and that&rsquo;s fine for the moment, but it&rsquo;s not going to stay like that for very long.</p>
