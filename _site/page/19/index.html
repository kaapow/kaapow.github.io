		<h1><a href="/2015/06/22/moon-racket-on.html">Moon Racket! on Medium</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>I’ve decided to use <a href="http://www.medium.com/@moonracket">Medium</a> as an additional platform from which I publish the new season of my comic, <em>Moon Racket!</em> Multiple factors coalesced to make this decision.</p>

<p>In the past I have used 3 different platforms to publish and distribute my comic strip:</p>

<ol><li>The official <a href="http://moonracket.com">website</a>, hosted on Tumblr</li>
<li>The <a href="http://tinyletter.com/moonracket">newsletter</a>, powered by Tinyletter</li>
<li>Tapastic (at least in the first season).</li>
</ol>
<p>Moving forward I’ll be publishing on Medium, <em>Moon Racket!</em> and through the newsletter. So what brought about this change? To answer that question, I think I should answer another question, how have the other platforms been faring?</p>

<p>The truth is that each of the above platforms provided very specific (detrimental) restrictions on the artwork itself, but also allowed for a potentially wider distribution. The problem is that this wider distribution never manifested itself in a meaningful way.</p>

<h3>Tumblr</h3>

<p>Moon Racket! is hosted on Tumblr, a platform usually suited for rectangular posts that fit within the stream that is present for eveyone. The restrictions on images are therefore made to suit their platform. The maximum size of image that can be posted is one that is 1200px wide. On a retina screen that’s the equivalent of a 600px image. The effect of this restriction is that my comic always appears blurry.</p>

<p>While this is a nitpick, for a perfectionist like myself, it’s a deal breaker.</p>

<h3>Newsletter</h3>

<p>If I thought that Tumblr provided restrictions, then I was in for a rude awakening with my newsletter experience. This one can only be typically shown in a 600px wide image, otherwise it will break most inboxes.</p>

<p>My experience with Tinyletter has been mixed. But ultimately my question for a beautiful experience was wrecked by that platform’s constraints. In mitigate I’ve moved things over to Mailchimp, which I’m hoping will offer better options and experience.</p>

<p>Even then, I’m still not showcasing the art in the best possible way.</p>

<h3>Tapastic</h3>

<p>This platform holds promise, but once again there are size restrictions to the images that can be uploaded. While the platform as a whole does allow for a plethora of things aimed at comic content creators, I don’t believe that I would be able to reap many (any?) of those benefits.</p>

<p>It’s also being lost in the sea that is being published there. Some of which is aimed at a very different audience.</p>

<hr />
<p>Which brings me to Medium.</p>

<p>The editor provided on Medium is without question the best editor on the internet, have tried a very large number of them.</p>

<p>The other instant win for Medium is how the platform chooses to deal with images. They’re not just first class citizens, they are allowed to exist in a manner that makes them shine. In fact the more I write about this, the more convinced I am of what an idiot I am for not considering this platform earlier.</p>

<p>The biggest question I have is whether I can connect with an audience for an all ages comic strip about a robot (Corgan) and his worm friend (Alfie) that live on the moon, that’s made of cheese on Medium.</p>

<p>That’s a journey I’m happy to take, because if nothing else I’ll take it in <strong>style</strong>.</p>

<p>I got a bunch of Shinhan Art pens last week. I was so excited to use them that this little image popped out in a matter of minutes. One of the most encouraging things about sticking with a bunch of characters is watching their evolution happen before your eyes. There is a confidence that I’m aware of and actually <em>really</em> enjoying experiencing at the moment. I just wish I could do this more regularly.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2015/06/09/gallery-moon-racket.html">Moon Racket Website Update</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>Ever since I ‘relaunched’ the <em>Moon Racket!</em> <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">website</a> I’ve not been particularly happy with the footer. I always knew that it would have to change. My initial use of the footer was to effectively send people to different parts of the net that related to all things <em>Moon Racket!</em> - the <a href="http://www.twitter.com/moonracket">Twitter</a> account, the facebook account, the <a href="http://www.tinyletter.com/moonracket">newsletter</a> and this <a href="http://www.procssr.tumblr.com">process blog</a>. All of these links have now moved to the very top of the website, in a nice menu bar, that’s out of the way, but fully accessible if needed.</p>

<p>I received some negative feedback, when I publishing the first season, that sticks in my mind. It was from a woman that didn’t really understand what was going on in the series. On reflection I totally get that. At the time I couldn’t do anything about it, as the stories and art had been created. I knew I had to do better with the second series.</p>

<p>In an attempt to make the series more accessible, the stories have been written to not be as presumtive, but also the website should be first time reader friendly. To address these two issues, I’ve decided to use the footer as a <strong>What You Need to Know</strong> section, complete with character head shots and names, using those sketches from the <a href="http://procssr.tumblr.com/post/120693390813/from-the-desk-1-first-in-the-series-a-set-of">previous post</a>.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p><em>Routine</em> is everything when you&rsquo;re trying to develop and build something. To aid the routine from happening and not being taken off the rails, <em>constraints</em> are typically added into the mix.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago I decided to publish something new every weekday on this here process site. While I definitely don&rsquo;t want to go <em>meta</em> (and blog about blogging), I thought it was important to note that I&rsquo;ve come up with a way to help guide me through this publishing schedule. Each week I&rsquo;ll aim to publish a post in one of these categories:</p>

<ol><li>Marketing</li>
<li>Design</li>
<li>Character Development</li>
<li>From my Desk</li>
<li>Tools of the Trade</li>
</ol>
<p>The reason for publishing is that it focuses my mind to <strong>always be creating</strong>. It&rsquo;s also a great way to help me work things out. Publishing something online is somehow more concrete that writing a bunch of words either in notebooks or in random text files that live in my Dropbox folder.</p>

<p>Not sure how the idea came about, but this is effectively Alfie’s first appearance.</p>

<p>I needed a colour that would <em>pop</em> against the grey backgrounds that I was using. I also remember that after I drew him I realised that the little guy was an organic being and so would need an air bubble to breathe through while on the moon…please don’t argue with my logic, it’s <strong>fragile</strong>.</p>

<p>This is also the only time that Alfie would be drawn this small. All subsequent drawings have him coming to Corgan’s shoulder.</p>

Living away from any family that can help us with the boy has been a challenge at times, but these 22 programmes have acted like a baby sitter of sorts to keep him occupied briefly while we do things like eating our dinner, cleaning up the kitchen or putting a laundry - you know the super exciting things in life.</p>

<p>Zane <em>loves</em> these characters. Something about them strike a real cord with him. So when his first birthday came about, I knew we had to celebrate with them. I’m planning on getting the art behind these characters made as a print soon to hang up in his room.</p>

<p>What’s amazing to me is just how great the cake came out, it’s a technology I’ve seen used before (as I was reminded by my wife), but I’ve never done anything with it. Here’s to many more happy birthday’s Zane. What a year it’s beeen.</p>
