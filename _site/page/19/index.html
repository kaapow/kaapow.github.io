		<h1><a href="/2015/12/20/024709.html">2016</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>5 months. That’s a really long time between updates. The truth is that I was creating things until at least the very end of september, it just so happened that I wasn’t really in the mood to talk about them.</p>

<p>The main reason for the radio silence over the autumn and start of winter is down to the fact that I’m relocating to Dubai. That’s been a huge drain on all of my ‘free’ time and drawing and creating has been relegated to the <em>too difficult to deal with</em> drawer.</p>

<p>I have decided to take this time to reflect on what I want to do with my creative output once things have settled down a little bit more.</p>

<h2>Moon Racket!</h2>

<p>I’ve got 10-15 new strips of <a href="http://moonracket.com">Moon Racket!</a> to publish and then I’d like to stick to the routine of publishing something new to <em>Moon Racket!</em> at least once a week for the entire year of 2016.  Obviously I’ll likely fail, but I want to at least <strong>try.</strong></p>

<p>The main focus moving forward will be to improve the strip with actual backgrounds. I’m painfully aware at the general lack of backgrounds and environment that is missing (or at least that could be better defined than right now).</p>

<p>However I won’t be publishing 4 panel strips. It’s not how my brain works. Rather I’ll be writing stories that will take up several panels, maybe entire pages with these characters in them. I have the first story roughed out, so just need to get cracking.</p>

<h2>Chroma</h2>

<p>The real push in 2016 will be for me to finally draw and start publishing <em>Chroma</em>. This is a very long time coming and I feel that if I don’t do it now, I’ll likely never do it. After multiple attempts at starting this project, I’m now of the mind that it’s better to get it out there, in whatever form it comes, rather than trying to get it perfect from day one. It will never be that so I should stop worrying about it.</p>

<h2>Creative Output</h2>

<p>If I’m able to publish 1 page a month of <em>Chroma</em>  and the weekly <em>Moon Racket!</em> page, then 2016 is likely going to be a MONSTER year . I’m fully aware that this is an ambitious programme for me (considering what goes into moving to a city like Dubai), but this is work that I’ll be carrying out first thing in the morning. The intention is to carry out 1-2 hours of creative output a day, <em>every</em> day, <em>every</em> morning.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2015/10/30/adventure-in-stationary.html">Adventure in Stationary</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>For years I&rsquo;ve been exceptionally content with my choice of pen, the Muji 0.38mm gel ink pen, in <strong>black</strong>. The main issue with the pen was the cheap plastic enclosure that held that wonderful refill. I grew exceptionally bored of it and I was willing to splurge some money on something that was better.</p>

<p>Previously I&rsquo;d splash money on stationary related to my artwork, but never for my work related stationary. My hunt for a better enclosure made me look at all of my stationary in a decidedly different way and led me down a rabbit hole that I am yet to emerge from (listened to all the episodes of the <a href="http://www.relay.fm/penaddict">Pen Addict podcast</a>). Thankfully the situation is a lot more under control than when I first started on this journey. After a year of buying a wide range of pens, I now know pretty much what will appeal to me and will fit into my rotation pretty much instantly.</p>

<p>I intend to go into a decent amount of detail but rather than writing everything in one single shot, I&rsquo;ll highlight the main takes for now:</p>

<ol><li>I&rsquo;m likely not going to be expanding my fountain pen collection past a <a href="http://www.pelikan.com/pulse/Pulsar/en_US_INTL.FWI.displayShop.106959./classic-205-black-silver">Pelikan M205</a> in the future. It stops here at my <a href="http://www.sailorpen.com/professional-gear.html">Sailor Pro Gear Slim</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.midori-japan.co.jp/md/en/products/notebook.html">Midori MDs</a> are the only choice of sketch notebooks that I will likely ever use. These are perfect. The A4 version is next on my list.</li>
<li>Nothing beats my <a href="http://www.muji.eu/pages/online.asp?Sec=13&amp;Sub=52">Muji 0.38mm pen</a> for quick sketching and inking - the <em>Pilot Juice</em> pens come in a close second. I&rsquo;ve still to find my ideal holder - the original Takumi pen was a massive disappointment, hopefully version 2 goes in a better direction. Might have to design one myself.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve enjoyed using my <a href="http://www.1101.com/store/techo/2016/planner/index.html">Hobonichi Techo</a> (although not as often as I would want to and not with the type of content I was hoping for) - will be trying out an A5 version this year., maybe that format suits me better?</li>
<li>I will be getting a Nanami <a href="http://www.nanamipaper.com/products/copy-of-seven-seas-standard-a5-blank-journal.html">Seven Seas Standard</a> notebook in the future as well.</li>
<li>The Penxo is one of the best conceived and delivered Kickstarters that I&rsquo;ve ever used - even though they fucked up my order and gave me the wrong leads.</li>
<li>I will be getting a <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/colors/">Field Notes</a> subscription in November. I like the fun of seeing what these guys come up with and have been enjoying collecting these notebooks.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve still not found my ideal EDC pen. I still have time to back the <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/buy/karas-kustoms-edk">EDK</a>, but not sure if that&rsquo;s the one for me.</li>

		<h1><a href="/2015/08/22/gallery-its-been.html">Hobonichi Techo 2016</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>It’s been a year already? The latest lineup for the Hobonichi Techo 2016 (in Japanese for now) is <a href="http://www.1101.com/store/techo/">online</a>. Unlike last year, where I was completely taken by the buzz and the excitement of something new, I now know what to expect and more crucially what I like and need.</p>

<p>The A6 size hasn’t worked out for me as I would have liked. I found myself running out of space on occasions, or ended up looking to complete my thoughts elsewhere. That’s going to have to change if I’m going to use this book as my catchall for everything. I am a huge lover of the A5 size, and while the ‘Cousin’ version of the Hobonichi planner is in fact all in Japanese, it’s functional enough to not be a problem.</p>

<p>The biggest draw for this notebook is the paper, which is without equal. I’ve tried many different papers this year, but the Tomoe River paper has stood out as the undeputed champion when it comes to making the most out of inks and pens that I use.</p>

<p>The Hobonichi Techo will remain my notebook of choice, where I dump all my thoughts and ideas into a single place. The only bad thing is that I now need a new cover - the new ones are a big disappointment, so I’m looking to Etsy for some alternatives. Top of my list are these covers from <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/241142080/a5-burgundy-leather-notebook-journal?ref=shop_home_feat_4">StrideRidge</a> - and they’re actually affordable unlike some of these ‘official’ covers on offer.</p>
