		<h1><a href="/2015/06/09/gallery-moon-racket.html">Moon Racket Website Update</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>Ever since I ‘relaunched’ the <em>Moon Racket!</em> <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">website</a> I’ve not been particularly happy with the footer. I always knew that it would have to change. My initial use of the footer was to effectively send people to different parts of the net that related to all things <em>Moon Racket!</em> - the <a href="http://www.twitter.com/moonracket">Twitter</a> account, the facebook account, the <a href="http://www.tinyletter.com/moonracket">newsletter</a> and this <a href="http://www.procssr.tumblr.com">process blog</a>. All of these links have now moved to the very top of the website, in a nice menu bar, that’s out of the way, but fully accessible if needed.</p>

<p>I received some negative feedback, when I publishing the first season, that sticks in my mind. It was from a woman that didn’t really understand what was going on in the series. On reflection I totally get that. At the time I couldn’t do anything about it, as the stories and art had been created. I knew I had to do better with the second series.</p>

<p>In an attempt to make the series more accessible, the stories have been written to not be as presumtive, but also the website should be first time reader friendly. To address these two issues, I’ve decided to use the footer as a <strong>What You Need to Know</strong> section, complete with character head shots and names, using those sketches from the <a href="http://procssr.tumblr.com/post/120693390813/from-the-desk-1-first-in-the-series-a-set-of">previous post</a>.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p><em>Routine</em> is everything when you&rsquo;re trying to develop and build something. To aid the routine from happening and not being taken off the rails, <em>constraints</em> are typically added into the mix.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago I decided to publish something new every weekday on this here process site. While I definitely don&rsquo;t want to go <em>meta</em> (and blog about blogging), I thought it was important to note that I&rsquo;ve come up with a way to help guide me through this publishing schedule. Each week I&rsquo;ll aim to publish a post in one of these categories:</p>

<ol><li>Marketing</li>
<li>Design</li>
<li>Character Development</li>
<li>From my Desk</li>
<li>Tools of the Trade</li>
</ol>
<p>The reason for publishing is that it focuses my mind to <strong>always be creating</strong>. It&rsquo;s also a great way to help me work things out. Publishing something online is somehow more concrete that writing a bunch of words either in notebooks or in random text files that live in my Dropbox folder.</p>

<p>Not sure how the idea came about, but this is effectively Alfie’s first appearance.</p>

<p>I needed a colour that would <em>pop</em> against the grey backgrounds that I was using. I also remember that after I drew him I realised that the little guy was an organic being and so would need an air bubble to breathe through while on the moon…please don’t argue with my logic, it’s <strong>fragile</strong>.</p>

<p>This is also the only time that Alfie would be drawn this small. All subsequent drawings have him coming to Corgan’s shoulder.</p>

Living away from any family that can help us with the boy has been a challenge at times, but these 22 programmes have acted like a baby sitter of sorts to keep him occupied briefly while we do things like eating our dinner, cleaning up the kitchen or putting a laundry - you know the super exciting things in life.</p>

<p>Zane <em>loves</em> these characters. Something about them strike a real cord with him. So when his first birthday came about, I knew we had to celebrate with them. I’m planning on getting the art behind these characters made as a print soon to hang up in his room.</p>

<p>What’s amazing to me is just how great the cake came out, it’s a technology I’ve seen used before (as I was reminded by my wife), but I’ve never done anything with it. Here’s to many more happy birthday’s Zane. What a year it’s beeen.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p><em>What kind of audience do I think <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket!</a> is intended for and how do I reach them?</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been struggling with this question a lot recently, in the lead up to releasing the second season. This then brought up a series of <em>other</em> questions.</p>

<ol><li>What are the topics the series tackles?</li>
<li>Where can I find an audience and declare to them the genius that is <em>Moon Racket!</em>, while not appearing like a <strong>complete</strong> douche bag pimping my shit like a second rate car salesman?</li>
<li>Can I focus on a niche group of people with a specific interest, that would appreciate <em>Moon Racket!</em> and what it has to offer?</li>
<li>Is this series even worth promoting?</li>
</ol>
<p>My intention has always been to create a great strip, that I would like to see myself and I never honestly even considered these questions  when I created the strip. I <em>foolishly</em> expected that between Facebook and Twitter there would be an <em>easy</em> way of marketing my wares. The reality of course is far different and that achieving any traction via social media is reasonably limited (at least for my little webcomic).</p>

<p>In order to try and find different answers and solutions to this question, I&rsquo;ll be tackling this topic in more detail over the coming weeks, reporting on how certain avenues have actually helped the cause.</p>

<p>Continuing this series of posts on the evolution of characters from <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket!</a>, this is first full sketch of Corgan.</p>

<p>What’s facinating to me is just how much information was captured in this one image that I don’t even remember creating. The main features of the character are there, such as the white boots, the shape of the head and the eyes and most importantly the colour palette that was chosen.</p>

<p>The neck reduced in height significantly in later iterations, but this has always been a general favourite sketch of mine because it helped define the world I am trying to create in many subtle ways.</p>

<p>The image that started <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a>.</p>

<p>The incredible part (when you consider the physical and hardware constraints) is that it was all created on an iPhone 4. I’ve written about this before (probably on my now defunct Facebook page), the intention was to create a super <em>simple</em> character that could be easily drawn on that tiny little screen.</p>

<p>As time went on, the character evolved. While I now find him incredibly easy to draw (and can tell instantly when I’ve not done a good job of my lines), that wasn’t always the case.</p>

<p>In fact the first year of Corgan’s life, I wasn’t super comfortable with certain aspects of his drawing him (so much so I remember the very first strip, I thought to trace him as I spent long on the first panel, but quickly realised that I was being stupid and foolish).</p>

<p>For my personal musing site, I recently updated the CSS code to benefit from some of the theme editing functions that Tumblr provides. The whole design of <a href="http://www.aboualfa.tumblr.com">KAA</a> was intentionally completely text based to allow me to have infinite colour combinations.</p>

<p>As a fun experiment, I’ve been taking screenshots of the various colour schemes that I come up with.</p>

<p>Of course, the fact that I’ve not actually written anything meaningful on there for 5 months begs the question of why the design is even relevant, I’m just glad it’s there for when I <strong>eventually</strong> pull my finger out.</p>

<p>This is one of the first images I ever drew using blue pencil lead instead of standard graphite. It’s also one of the first images that shows all the recent iterations of the characters are located in one image.</p>

<p>This image however was done pretty quickly (over an evening in fact, pencil to ink) and was meant to be a way of flexing my muscles. I didn’t even know what the characters were saying to each other (or why). You can read the final strip <a href="http://moonracket.com/post/117317667409/season-two-teaser">here</a>.</p>

<p>My biggest error (and I don’t know how it got through) was Woz’s stamp, where the perspective is all wrong. Sometime you just need a simple idea, which lets your pencil move - what you sacrifice for this freedom of movement is that the end result might not be as polished as you would hope.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>There is much to like about Tumblr and publishing on Tumblr. There are however some constraints that I have been trying to work my way through. <em>High resolution</em> images on Tumblr are constrained in size to 1280px for normal high res photos and 2560x500px for panorama photos.</p>

<p>The problem is that Moon Racket strips don&rsquo;t really fall into either category. I could potentially use the panorama photos setting, but that would mean making things fit into a 500px height (which isn&rsquo;t great). Here&rsquo;s a look of what the panorma would look like using the <a href="http://moonracket.com/post/119418092109/in-plain-sight">latest weekly</a> (which dropped yesterday):</p>

<p><img src="http://www.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/a59360f369.jpg" alt="Panorama" /></p>

<p>Alternatively I could upload the image as 1280px. On a retina display that works out to be a 640px image (which honestly is tiny). My website allows for a 960px width - on a retina display that&rsquo;s 1920px. If I do let Tumblr do it&rsquo;s thing, then my crisp black lines that I&rsquo;ve worked long and hard on, become this blurred mess.</p>

<p>The only other solution I&rsquo;ve found is to host the images on Flickr and then link them over. I get to post the image that I want in any resolution that I please. This solution does not make for very good Tumblr citizen but it makes for a better web site.</p>

<hr />
<p>The irony of course is that both Flickr and Tumblr are owned by Yahoo! - so the image is hosted on their servers anyway. The whole thing is just annoying and you end up loosing out on some of the cool features that are inherently a part of Tumblr - for the sake of a few measily pixels.</p>
