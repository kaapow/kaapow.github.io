		<h1><a href="/2018/08/09/for-yourself.html">For yourself</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>While it’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that you’re writing on your website for the ‘internet’, the truth of the matter is that you’re actually writing these things and obsessing about it’s design primarily and sometimes exclusively for yourself.</p>

<p>These words are a snapshot in time. Of where you were and what you were doing. They might be reflections on what happened in your day or what’s currently captured your imagination.</p>

<p>Why not just write this in a journal you say? Because ‘publishing’ something on a site provides a level of finality. A level of accomplishment that a mere text file in a folder, or a journal entry in your notebook doesn’t provide. Not that there is anything wrong with either of those approaches, rather the online published version is <em>different</em>.</p>

<p>One of my favourite new feature/plugins on <a href="http://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> is ability to <a href="https://github.com/cleverdevil/micromemories">create an ‘on-this-day’ page</a> that collects your past posts that happened….erm, on this day.</p>

<p>The reason it’s so great is that it’s another clear tool, made for you. It’s made to allow you to reflect on what you’ve written in the past and what you were thinking 1, 2, 3 or more years ago. If you’re not <em>using</em> this feature, then you’re missing out on one of the joys about blogging, which is reflecting on what you’ve written.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/07/31/an-ode-to.html">An Ode to iAWriter </a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>Since April I have been working silently and diligently on my little project. I’ve still got a long while to go before I’m happy to share what’s been going on with me but I wanted to share my absolute recommendation for <a href="http://www.ia.net/writer">iAWriter</a> as one of the best tools for writing projects ever made.</p>

<p>Of significant value to me is the ability to link in multiple text files into a single document. This has allowed me to reorganise the entire project several times over, as though it was a simple deck of cards.</p>

<p>This feature alone would be enough for me, but that is just the start of things. It’s super lightweight and opens instantly. It doesn’t have any font features (except choosing between a single font) and that helps me from wasting type. Although there arent’ many templates to choose from, the basic ones included with the app do an amazing job of typesetting the work in a fashion that I can read/markup and edit freely.</p>

<p>Sure I would like a few features found in the <a href="https://quoteunquoteapps.com/highland-2/">Highland</a> app, such as sprint timer, native fountain support, and actual <em>comment</em> support within the document, but this app provides me with so much and I highly recommend you consider it for your next project.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>One of the single most powerful things that I hope to teach my kids, is to understand and appreciate the concept of consistent &amp; incremental. This applies to aspects of themselves and in everything around them. As long as you <strong>increment</strong> on a thing you’re working on and <strong>consistently</strong> show up every day you will eventually see results.</p>

<p>The hardest part is to percevier in the face of no visible improvement and keep moving forward. Set your course because you know it is true and try and remain on it.</p>
