		<h1><a href="/2018/03/07/soundgarden-kids.html">Soundgarden & Kids</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>Last night was the first <em>moment</em> shared by myself and my two boys. And a glorious moment it was.</p>

<p>Since Ryan’s been born, the activities shared by the boys has been somewhat limited. One is a 3 1/2 year old, while the other is 3 months old. Ryan though clearly has his father’s taste in music. To calm him down I’ve taken to singing to him alternative music from the 90s. We’ve just finished our <em>Smashing Pumpkins</em> phase and I started singing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySzrJ4GRF7s">Fell on black days</a>.</p>

<p>Having not heard the song in 10 years I thought it would be great to blast it out. I mean that’s why I have music subscription right? I’m holding Ryan and we’re <em>dad-shuffling</em> to the music.  A which point Zane decides he wants in on the action as well, so he grabs his massive Ikea shark and starts <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshing">moshing</a> (I put the link in because I have no idea if this is what it’s refered to these days, wait…they’re calling it slamdancing? I’ll stick with moshing thank you very much) with it. And it all escalated from there.</p>

<p>Although different in an infinitely number of ways, the whole scene did remind me of that time Stathi and I were 18-19 and went to this club in Athens who either had an alternative night on, or the DJ is hoping to get kicked out. Anyway he was playing <em>our</em> music, which by this stage had fallen out of favour in place of some other pop shit. Towards the end/middle of the night there we were literally the only 2 people on the floor <em>slamdancing</em>.</p>

<p>I think my 18-19 year old self would be super proud of these two.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/03/04/krama-studio-rollerball.html">Krama Studio Rollerball</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>The <a href="https://www.kramastudio.com">Krama</a> pen I <a href="https://www.kaa.bz/2018/02/23/finally-got-my.html">mentioned</a> 10 days ago, arrived today. I’ve not had much time to play with it yet, but my initial impressions are that the reasons for me backing the Kickstarter were valid.</p>

<p>The first quality that jumped out at me were the subtle details that show the manufacturers knew what they were doing. Having seen (and backed) enough Kickstarter machined pens, the quality of the <strong>coating</strong> on this pen reaches for the heady heights that a Rotring 600 provides, which is high praise indeed. No other Kickstarter pen has the same quality of coating.</p>

<p>It’s an exceptionally slight pen, no thicker really than a standard 6 sided pencil, so if you like heft to your writing experience, this really isn’t the pen for you. Having recognised the dimensions at play here, I ordered a brass version, which I definitely think is the correct way to go, using a different material would basically have changed the balance of the pen.</p>

<p>This is a simple pen, and that is where it’s beauty lies. The mechanism is a bit different to what I’ve seen for simple pens (like the <a href="http://baronfig.com">Squire</a> or Retro 51), but it’s done very well on this pen and the refill has no wriggle. Part of that I think are the tighter tolerances but also the fact that the back of the pen screws directly into the refill. I did not know that this was an option, but the fact that the pens are machined to consider these tolerances on a standard Schmidt refill is even more impressive.</p>

<p>The pen comes in a unique leather wrap, with a couple of brass rings that hold everything together.  What I like about this approach (and yes I understand that I’ve paid for the packaging already) is the fact that there is no plastics involved.</p>

<p>From my brief interaction with the pen, I would certainly recommend this pen to anyone looking for something unique but truly functional.</p>
