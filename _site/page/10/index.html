		<h1><a href="/2017/12/24/my-grandmother.html">My Grandmother</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>My earliest memory of my grandmother must have been when I was a little older than Zane (my eldest), I couldn‚Äôt have been more than 4 years old. It was just the two of us, my parents where elsewhere. She offered me a cheese ‚Äòashkawan‚Äô sandwich, which I hesitated but accepted. What she produced was a mature cheddar cheese sandwich of such epic flavour, I can still taste it 34 years on. After demolishing the first one, she could see I wasn‚Äôt done and so she asked me if I wanted another. I remember how happy she looked at being able to offer such a simple thing that could elisit such a reaction‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälike she‚Äôd discovered my route to happiness and was going to use it. She was a master at giving genuine happiness from the simplest of things at her disposal. She would offer this happiness throughout her life and to everyone she came into contact with. And lemonade. Lots of lemonade.</p>

<p>The way I see it, my grandmother‚Äôs job was to spoil me (and to a lesser extent my brother). To that end she did an outstanding job. When she found out that I liked the peanut M&amp;Ms, she made sure she had a complete box for me. I ate so many peanut M&amp;Ms that summer, I still can‚Äôt bring myself to eat them any more.</p>

<p>She would hand us an endless stream of toys with alarming regularity, and would take great pains to get something different and special. Sometimes I think she worked on these present ‚Äòprojects‚Äô all year, in anticipation of when we came to visit.</p>

<p>She was into <em>shisha</em> before it became fashionable‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand did it the right way, in the comfort of her own home, after a meal to pass a few hours while looking out onto the sea and watching the world go by.</p>

<p>Fiercely independent (she learnt the very hard way and very early on that she had to fend for herself) and with twice as much energy in her as other ladies her age (as experienced by the fact that she walked everywhere). Her favourite holiday destination was Syria (back before it was completely ravaged by war).</p>

<p>Even though I‚Äôve not had a two way conversation in over a decade with her, she was available to me during some tough times when I was in Lebanon. She helped me through them by being a willing ear.</p>

<p>Without a doubt, one of the highlights of my wedding (there were many that day), was seeing my grandmother attend‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääshe was bedridden for several years by that stage, so her attendance never even crossed my mind as a possibility. It took a lot for her to be there, and thankfully her nurse made it a reality.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/d9bea902d4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>My grandmother at my¬†wedding</p>

<p>A patient wife, a great neighbour, a dedicated aunt and a loyal sister‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämy grandmother was all these things and so much more.</p>

<p>After 9 hard years (being bedridden and paralysed), she finally laid her head to rest and left this world behind her. I loved my grandmother. She died today.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2017/09/24/stoicism.html">Stoicism</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>Every once in a while you stumble upon an idea that resonates with you. An idea that captures your imagination. It‚Äôs a unique idea that asks for action, that calls to be implemented and put into action and to become part of your daily practice. The latest such idea is <strong>Stoicism</strong>.</p>

<p>Although my brother had mentioned it in passing a while back, the information washed over me like someone telling me all about Bitcoin. I paid it no heed and carried on about my daily business.</p>

<p>In one of the latest episodes of the <a href="http://www.thejournal.email/podcast">Kevin Rose Show podcast</a>, Kevin Rose interviewed <a href="https://ryanholiday.net">Ryan Holiday</a> and what he said made a ton of sense to me, so I decided to take a deeper dive.</p>

<p>I jumped straight to Marcus Aurelius‚Äô <em>Meditations</em> and bought two versions. The first is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meditations-Translation-Marcus-Aurelius-2003-05-06/dp/B01N4HXUYQ/ref=sr_1_7?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1506162209&amp;sr=1-7&amp;keywords=meditations">Gregory Hays translation</a> recommended by Holiday. The second is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Emperors-Handbook-New-Translation-Meditations/dp/0743233832/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1506162209&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=meditations">The Emperor‚Äôs Handbook</a>) which my brother recommended.</p>

<p>I have since followed it up with Ryan Holiday‚Äôs <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Daily-Stoic-Meditations-Wisdom-Perseverance/dp/0735211736?tag=dailystoic07-20">Daily Stoic</a> as a good way to allow the ideas and ideology be digested in small bite sized nuggets. Of note is Holiday‚Äôs <a href="https://dailystoic.com">website</a> dedicated to spreading the Stoic word‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsubscribing to his newsletter gives you a decent sampler to know if this is something you‚Äôd like to dig a little deeper into.</p>

<p>The one exercise that I have taken to heart straight away is daily journaling twice a day. 10‚Äì15 minutes in the morning to capture what I want to achieve out of the day and 10‚Äì15 minutes in the evening to review and reflect on the day that passed and ask myself what I learnt and what I could do better.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>The truth is that I can‚Äôt help myself and keep coming back to these characters. I‚Äôve honestly tried to get into another project, but it‚Äôs clear that there is a whole world that needs to be explored, developed and discovered.</p>

<p>This process is both therapy for me and I see it as a way to hone some of my skills to tell a story, develop a world before I take my mediocre skills into something more serious or demanding.</p>

<p>What‚Äôs also clear to me, is that there is really no rush with these characters. This August marks 5 years since I first started working on Moon Racket! The below three images were created on an iPhone 4 as a way to use the Brushes app along with a <strong>really</strong> shitty stylus.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/d97975fb91.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Evolution of Corgan‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäCreated on an iPhone¬†4</p>

<p>Over time the characters have evolved significantly. The general ideas remain, however the details have changed and hopefully will continue to evolve.</p>

<h2>Cast of Characters</h2>

<p>This crept up on me to be honest. I started off with a grand total of 2 characters and little else. Over the course of the 5 years I‚Äôm now the proud owner of 10 characters and counting (I actually have a further 8 characters that I‚Äôll be showing off sooner or later, but more on that in a bit).</p>

<h2>Continuous Change</h2>

<p>What I continue to be surprised by, is the fact that every time I create a new image, it adds something new and interesting to this world. I‚Äôve only created two full images this year, but they basically added the orange colour which ties the art together, a new character (in Ison the rocket) and established a new vernacular for the type of buildings that I‚Äôd like to see throughout the Moon Racket! world (till now, I‚Äôd not shown the guys in the context of an actual physical place). Not bad for two images.</p>

<h2>Onomatopoeia</h2>

<p>I‚Äôve always felt that one of the main ‚Äòcharacters‚Äô in Moon Racket! should be the <em>onomatopoeia</em>. I‚Äôve not really utilised this very much and kept the general use of the text and fonts to a minimum. That‚Äôs one aspect that I would like to explore a little further in future iterations of these characters.</p>

<p>This is also the first time that I use a new font for signage. I‚Äôve chosen ‚ÄòPhosphate‚Äô as one option at the moment, although I also recognise that something more stylised might be necessary down the line.</p>

<h2>The Future</h2>

<p>Moving into the future, there is a children‚Äôs book that I am writing now‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääprobably why I‚Äôve not been drawing very much. It‚Äôs certainly taken a lot more out of me than I would have wanted. The concept is simple, but having read a considerable amount of children‚Äôs books over the last year, I would say that doing it in an exciting and fun way is a real challenge.</p>

<p>In an attempt at creating a new story, what I am looking into is to try and find a way to slowly create a story that is developed 1 panel at a time. The intention is to continue to draw on a regular basis and just build the story slowly and organically. I‚Äôm <em>reasonably</em> comfortable with the art side of things, that I‚Äôd like to flesh out these characters a little bit more and start to explore ideas and thoughts that I wonder about on a regular basis.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2017/08/07/hamzi-aboualfa.html">Hamzi Abou¬†Alfa</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>At 7am, on Thursday, 27th of July 2017, one of my father‚Äôs uncles died. You see my father‚Äôs uncles really were more like surrogate fathers than <em>uncles</em>. To think of them as only <em>uncles</em> is to do a disservice to their relationship.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not that hard for me to express my affection for Hamzi. A softly spoken man, with the warmest smile and fiendishly clever wit. His house, always an exceptionally warm place for me.</p>

<p>My fondest memories however of him are his interactions with my own father. My father could never say no to Hamzi. If ever he had a real weakness to his uncles, it was for Hamzi. Every uncle embodied a different lesson in life, from Hamzi he learnt kindness.</p>

<p>Sometimes Hamzi would frustrate my dad in a way that I could <strong>instantly</strong> relate to, as I would oftentimes experience that very same frustrations with my own father. Those frustrations melt away when you understand that you are completely powerless to do anything, just smiling and get on with, knowing that this person has stood by you in thousands of big and small ways throughout your life.</p>

<p>The hardest part of today however was the thought of his daughter Farah rushing through the airports, through the traffic to try and get to her father‚Äôs funeral. I don‚Äôt know why this mental image just destroys me‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämaybe because it‚Äôs the image that made the whole situation real for me. The moment you realise that he‚Äôs physically gone.</p>

<p>Of the many legacies that one can leave behind, memories of those you touched feed the fire and keep the person‚Äôs spirit alive in your mind ‚Äî in that way he‚Äôs never gone. Another legacy would be in the children you helped raise. In that regard Hamzi and his wife Ouhayla, have left an incredible legacy in their children who have the same humility and kindness, as their parents before them.</p>

<p>I checked the last time I wrote about death in my family was for my dad‚Äôs other uncle Ahmed, who passed away 9 years ago now. I wrote that eulogy when the wound was still raw. Ahmed wasn‚Äôt <em>the</em> last gentleman of Saida, he was but <em>one</em> of the last. Hamzi, like his brother before him, undoubtedly belongs within this elite group.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2017/01/04/my-thoughts-onbrexit.html">My thoughts on¬†Brexit</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>So I honestly didn‚Äôt think that the first series that I would be writing about is Brexit. I thought I‚Äôd be talking about something simple like waste in the house, energy efficiencies and creativity. No instead I get to delve into what happens after the referendum of 23rd of June,¬†2016.</p>

<p>Before we get to that, a little personal history is in order. I feel that it‚Äôs important for me to write some of my thoughts on Brexit and the referendum, <em>mainly</em> for myself, so that I can review in a few years time what it is that I was actually thinking, and <em>partly</em> for my son when he asks me in the future why Britain is not part of the European Union.</p>

<p>I grew up in Greece, which against all odds remains as part of the European Union. My formative years were lived in the UK (started my life in Nottingham before moving down like many to London). For the last 6 years I‚Äôve lived outside the UK. That‚Äôs a long time and I‚Äôve missed out on some truly amazing things. The referendum on the 23rd of June 2016 however has to be one of the most important things that I wasn‚Äôt really a part of. Something that will both affect my future and my son‚Äôs future.</p>

<p>The reason for my leaving the UK are generally that even being an Engineer working for one of the most respected consultancy firms in the world, life in the UK is built around the concept of at least two income per households ‚Äî everything else is a bit of a struggle for survival or an incredibly miserable grind.</p>

<p>My single biggest issue with Brexit, apart from the fact that it‚Äôs an ill conceived reaction led by a bunch of buffoons with little to no understanding of the damage that it will do to millions of people, is the fact that overall it‚Äôs a clear sign of people and humanity moving in the <em>wrong</em> direction. Rather than being inclusive of each other, we are pushing each other away and building boundaries between us ‚Äî whether artificial or real.</p>

<p>Frankly the whole situation has broken my heart and my spirit a little bit. Growing up in Athens, but with no European Citizenship, I know what it feels like to be out of the union. In a few years time, I will have this feeling all over again.</p>
