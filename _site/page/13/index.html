		<h1><a href="/2017/09/24/stoicism.html">Stoicism</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>Every once in a while you stumble upon an idea that resonates with you. An idea that captures your imagination. It’s a unique idea that asks for action, that calls to be implemented and put into action and to become part of your daily practice. The latest such idea is <strong>Stoicism</strong>.</p>

<p>Although my brother had mentioned it in passing a while back, the information washed over me like someone telling me all about Bitcoin. I paid it no heed and carried on about my daily business.</p>

<p>In one of the latest episodes of the <a href="http://www.thejournal.email/podcast">Kevin Rose Show podcast</a>, Kevin Rose interviewed <a href="https://ryanholiday.net">Ryan Holiday</a> and what he said made a ton of sense to me, so I decided to take a deeper dive.</p>

<p>I jumped straight to Marcus Aurelius’ <em>Meditations</em> and bought two versions. The first is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meditations-Translation-Marcus-Aurelius-2003-05-06/dp/B01N4HXUYQ/ref=sr_1_7?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1506162209&amp;sr=1-7&amp;keywords=meditations">Gregory Hays translation</a> recommended by Holiday. The second is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Emperors-Handbook-New-Translation-Meditations/dp/0743233832/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1506162209&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=meditations">The Emperor’s Handbook</a>) which my brother recommended.</p>

<p>I have since followed it up with Ryan Holiday’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Daily-Stoic-Meditations-Wisdom-Perseverance/dp/0735211736?tag=dailystoic07-20">Daily Stoic</a> as a good way to allow the ideas and ideology be digested in small bite sized nuggets. Of note is Holiday’s <a href="https://dailystoic.com">website</a> dedicated to spreading the Stoic word — subscribing to his newsletter gives you a decent sampler to know if this is something you’d like to dig a little deeper into.</p>

<p>The one exercise that I have taken to heart straight away is daily journaling twice a day. 10–15 minutes in the morning to capture what I want to achieve out of the day and 10–15 minutes in the evening to review and reflect on the day that passed and ask myself what I learnt and what I could do better.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2017/08/09/then-andnow.html">Then and Now</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>The truth is that I can’t help myself and keep coming back to these characters. I’ve honestly tried to get into another project, but it’s clear that there is a whole world that needs to be explored, developed and discovered.</p>

<p>This process is both therapy for me and I see it as a way to hone some of my skills to tell a story, develop a world before I take my mediocre skills into something more serious or demanding.</p>

<p>What’s also clear to me, is that there is really no rush with these characters. This August marks 5 years since I first started working on Moon Racket! The below three images were created on an iPhone 4 as a way to use the Brushes app along with a <strong>really</strong> shitty stylus.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/d97975fb91.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Evolution of Corgan — Created on an iPhone 4</p>

<p>Over time the characters have evolved significantly. The general ideas remain, however the details have changed and hopefully will continue to evolve.</p>

<h2>Cast of Characters</h2>

<p>This crept up on me to be honest. I started off with a grand total of 2 characters and little else. Over the course of the 5 years I’m now the proud owner of 10 characters and counting (I actually have a further 8 characters that I’ll be showing off sooner or later, but more on that in a bit).</p>

<h2>Continuous Change</h2>

<p>What I continue to be surprised by, is the fact that every time I create a new image, it adds something new and interesting to this world. I’ve only created two full images this year, but they basically added the orange colour which ties the art together, a new character (in Ison the rocket) and established a new vernacular for the type of buildings that I’d like to see throughout the Moon Racket! world (till now, I’d not shown the guys in the context of an actual physical place). Not bad for two images.</p>

<p>Completed colour artwork for header</p>

<h2>Onomatopoeia</h2>

<p>I’ve always felt that one of the main ‘characters’ in Moon Racket! should be the <em>onomatopoeia</em>. I’ve not really utilised this very much and kept the general use of the text and fonts to a minimum. That’s one aspect that I would like to explore a little further in future iterations of these characters.</p>

<p>This is also the first time that I use a new font for signage. I’ve chosen ‘Phosphate’ as one option at the moment, although I also recognise that something more stylised might be necessary down the line.</p>

<h2>The Future</h2>

<p>Moving into the future, there is a children’s book that I am writing now — probably why I’ve not been drawing very much. It’s certainly taken a lot more out of me than I would have wanted. The concept is simple, but having read a considerable amount of children’s books over the last year, I would say that doing it in an exciting and fun way is a real challenge.</p>

<p>In an attempt at creating a new story, what I am looking into is to try and find a way to slowly create a story that is developed 1 panel at a time. The intention is to continue to draw on a regular basis and just build the story slowly and organically. I’m <em>reasonably</em> comfortable with the art side of things, that I’d like to flesh out these characters a little bit more and start to explore ideas and thoughts that I wonder about on a regular basis.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2017/08/07/hamzi-aboualfa.html">Hamzi Abou Alfa</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>At 7am, on Thursday, 27th of July 2017, one of my father’s uncles died. You see my father’s uncles really were more like surrogate fathers than <em>uncles</em>. To think of them as only <em>uncles</em> is to do a disservice to their relationship.</p>

<p>It’s not that hard for me to express my affection for Hamzi. A softly spoken man, with the warmest smile and fiendishly clever wit. His house, always an exceptionally warm place for me.</p>

<p>My fondest memories however of him are his interactions with my own father. My father could never say no to Hamzi. If ever he had a real weakness to his uncles, it was for Hamzi. Every uncle embodied a different lesson in life, from Hamzi he learnt kindness.</p>

<p>Sometimes Hamzi would frustrate my dad in a way that I could <strong>instantly</strong> relate to, as I would oftentimes experience that very same frustrations with my own father. Those frustrations melt away when you understand that you are completely powerless to do anything, just smiling and get on with, knowing that this person has stood by you in thousands of big and small ways throughout your life.</p>

<p>The hardest part of today however was the thought of his daughter Farah rushing through the airports, through the traffic to try and get to her father’s funeral. I don’t know why this mental image just destroys me — maybe because it’s the image that made the whole situation real for me. The moment you realise that he’s physically gone.</p>

<p>Of the many legacies that one can leave behind, memories of those you touched feed the fire and keep the person’s spirit alive in your mind — in that way he’s never gone. Another legacy would be in the children you helped raise. In that regard Hamzi and his wife Ouhayla, have left an incredible legacy in their children who have the same humility and kindness, as their parents before them.</p>

<p>I checked the last time I wrote about death in my family was for my dad’s other uncle Ahmed, who passed away 9 years ago now. I wrote that eulogy when the wound was still raw. Ahmed wasn’t <em>the</em> last gentleman of Saida, he was but <em>one</em> of the last. Hamzi, like his brother before him, undoubtedly belongs within this elite group.</p>
