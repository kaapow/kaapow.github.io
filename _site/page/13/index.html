      <div class="e-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been drawing <a href="http://moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a> for several years now. You wouldn&rsquo;t know it, as I&rsquo;ve only released around 23 images in total. The truth is that I&rsquo;ve got hundreds of sketches, doodles and even strips that have not been released (apart from the odd snap on <a href="http://instagram.com/khaledaboualfa">Instagram</a>). There are two resons for this:</p>

<ol><li><strong>Quality</strong>. The creative process and the quality in the first few years really wasn&rsquo;t that great. When I look back at <em>Season One</em> I cringe (and that was the art I was &lsquo;happy&rsquo; with at the time). However if I didn&rsquo;t persevere, then I wouldn&rsquo;t be in the position I am now, where I am comfortable enough to draw the characters in a few short minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Schedule</strong>. This one is actually a self imposed reason. My thinking being that I cannot really predict how often I&rsquo;m likely to finish a drawing and do all the necessary post-production work. So instead the idea was to bank an entire season before I started publishing. The problem with this decision, is that nothing gets published (in my case over a year) and any momentum is lost.</li>
</ol>
<p>That is actually an issue that I would <em>like</em> to address. The simplest solution is to publish things as they become available and ignore the whole issue of <em>schedule</em>. As a companion to this solution I&rsquo;ve also decided to create small single image strip (created in my favourite notebooks of all time, the Midori MD A5 notebooks) that takes a few hours to draw and ink to provide stop gaps between more involved strips.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the first image.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2015/02/19/amazon-comment.html">Amazon Comment</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>How often do you read a comment to a review on Amazon and can&rsquo;t stop laugh? This comment for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HYOGTTG">Zojirushi SM-SA48-BA Stainless Steel Mug</a> is one of those.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I bought the 20-ounce Zojirushi SM-SA60-BA the week after I got married so that I could keep my coffee warm on the commute to and from my new job downtown. It is literally the world&rsquo;s best travel mug. I could put steaming hot coffee in it in the morning, and if I forgot it in my truck I would still have steaming hot coffee for the drive home. No kidding! It&rsquo;s incredible. This was an exciting time for me. My time with Jennifer was limited but boundless in its glory. When I wasn&rsquo;t working, Jennifer and I would go hiking at the park, take road trips, sit up late and watch the stars. And, of course, have long nights of passionate love making. And through it all, my 20-ounce Zojirushi SM-SA60-BA provided me with hot, fresh coffee and a sleek, ergonomic feel. It&rsquo;s amazingly well designed and made to last.That was seven years ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He then follows it up with this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These days, Jennifer is as cold and emotionally distant as an uncharted asteroid. Now the most passionate conversations we have involve either our fiberoptic internet bandwidth or Your Damn Mother. At work, I am merely a shadow defined by once-authentic ambition. Original thought at my office is as pointless as a Libertarian vote, and my commute is like a scene from Walking Dead. I&rsquo;m writing this on my iPhone as I sit behind a third-world chicken truck on I-35. I&rsquo;m numbing myself to waste another eight hours at The Bad Place and fantasizing about replacing the painful vacuum of affection from She Who Cannot Read Oil Change Reminder Stickers with that new girl from logistics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And ends strongly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But now that I think about it, the one constant source of warmth and comfort in my life is still the 20-ounce Zojirushi SM-SA60-BA. Buy one. Buy one now, or feel only the chill yearning for an early grave that poor life decisions and emotional complacency can reap.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also bonus, read the followup <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R37USG0ZWZUEQM/ref=cm_cr_dp_cmt?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00HYOGUM2&amp;nodeID=284507&amp;store=kitchen#wasThisHelpful">comments</a> which give the actual truth, which is a lot more heartwarming.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2015/02/07/progress-report.html">Progress Report #1</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>It’s been a while since I checked in on progress for <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a> Season 2. My <em>original</em> deadline for this season has shifted somewhat, but my plan was somewhat flawed in that I thought I could finish off the art the same year that  Zane (my son) was born - I am that <em>hopelessly</em> optimistic. That was never going to really happen. 
The good news is that I made incredible progress while I was on holiday and thankfully I am still riding that momentum. When I left in  December I had 6 strips fully completed. Now a little over a month later I have over 20 strips that are in varying degrees of completness. In addition to that I was able to work through the thumbnails for the remaining 10 strips. That&rsquo;s right, unlike the first season (which was 20 strips in total),  Season 2 will be expanded to 30 strips.</p>

<h3>Frictionless Creation</h3>

<p>I attribute the fact that I&rsquo;ve been able to create <em>anything</em> at all to the fact that I&rsquo;ve made a concerted effort in trying to remove as much friction in the creation process as possible.</p>

<ol><li>Make sure that each script has the thumbnails worked out for the entire page. Doodle, change the script if necessary.</li>
<li>Do all the lettering. I use <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch">Sketch</a> for this as it&rsquo;s my Freehand alternative. This gives me the word placement so that I can taylor the art accordingly (make sure the character&rsquo;s head isn&rsquo;t covered by a balloon).</li>
<li>As I&rsquo;m drawing all the artwork on A3 board, I need to cut them down the middle. I then also drew all the panels in, so that I have one less excuse to actually getting started on the art (ie doing something without actually doing anything).</li>
</ol>
<h3>Hopes &amp; Aspirations</h3>

<p>One of my desires for this strip, is that as I continue to draw it in the future, I&rsquo;ll always be able to look back and see a progression from the previous year. It means that I&rsquo;m trying to make the strip better and make myself better at the creation process. What I didn&rsquo;t anticipate was seeing a fluidity in the characters between the very first strip I drew and the recent strips.</p>

<p>This poses the question of whether I should go back and rework the original drawings to meet that fluidity or leave them as they currently are as a marker. My initial reaction is to leave them as they are. This is an ongoing strip, rather than a finite graphic novel. Things don&rsquo;t actually have to look consistent (nor do they, when you compare the very first season even).</p>

<h3>Deadlines</h3>

<p>I know I shouldn&rsquo;t really tempt fate and declare a deadline, but I want to be able to start publishing the newest season in the spring some time and feel that this goal is completely within my reach. The next massive hurdle that I have to start considering is how I promote the hell out of this series once I&rsquo;m finally ready to actually publish. More on that in future posts.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>The wind outside is <strong>howling</strong>. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s 4am in the morning and I can&rsquo;t sleep. Having a new baby will destroy this fragile thing called sleep. It doesn&rsquo;t exist for me in the way it did a year ago - maybe it was longer than that, I can&rsquo;t remember.</p>

<p>The house is creaking with every movement of the wind. </p>

<p>Of course it&rsquo;s the hour of the <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour_of_the_wolf">wolf</a>. I&rsquo;m still amazed on how little sleep one can <em>function</em> on. </p>

<p>The windows rattle with every major gust that blows.</p>

<p>At this time of the night, when everyone else is asleep your mind wanders to nothing in particular and crazy details that will be completely forgotten in the harsh light of the new day. You&rsquo;re alone with your thoughts and they mean nothing because they are not letting you find your sleep. </p>

<p>The wind outside will not relent. If you listen carefully, you hear the city bend to it&rsquo;s will. Metal against concrete, the screech of a cat, a car alarm (idiots still use those?).</p>

		<h1><a href="/2014/12/31/distractions.html">Distractions</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>I&rsquo;m currently on holiday, which typically means that I have enough time to consider various aspects of my life. For this trip I decided to leave my computer at home.The reason for this were two-fold.</p>

<p>The first reason was really about my general <em>transition</em> over the last several months away from the digital and more into the analogue. As a more pencil, paper and pen inclined man, I wanted to disconnect a little bit more.</p>

<p>The second reason is the big one, <strong>distractions</strong>. With a fully capable computer, my possibilities for wondering into a different world, creating something else, or &lsquo;researching&rsquo; is near infinite. I know this of myself and I wanted to limit that access.</p>

<p>Instead I took my new iPhone 6 and a bluetooth keyboard bought over 7 years ago now (Apple doesn&rsquo;t build shit). Ideas would begin life on paper first and then would move over to the digital world. The digital is the final destination (at least at the moment). It is the final product, how ideas and art is shared others - a delivery medium many take for granted because of it&rsquo;s ubiquitous nature.</p>

<p>Overall, this process has helped me focus greatly on <a href="http://moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a> (I&rsquo;ll have more to discuss about this on my <a href="http://brokenkode.com">process site</a>) and allowed my mind to engage more with my family which has grown by 1 this year.</p>

<p>One of my goals for the year is to try and write more (promise this will be the only time I write about writing more, I&rsquo;m as jaded about these types of posts like you are). I enjoy the process of writing something a little more longform. There are plenty of places for me to capture my banal and personal musing (that&rsquo;s either in my <a href="http://www.1101.com/store/techo/2015/planner/">Hobonichi Techo</a> or within <a href="http://dayoneapp.com">Day One</a>). This site will be a way for me to work some things out. Once a week. The length and format isn&rsquo;t as important as the mere act of writing and exercising this muscle that was used on a regular basis some 10 years ago and which has gone dormant over the last 5 years.</p>

<p>Sometimes you need to spend some time on a particular character, over and over and over again. You develop a rhythm. It’s not until I finished this image that I feel comfortable enough to draw these characters in any situation.</p>

<p>Inktober is over, but like I said, it was fun to do and actually pretty useful for me (more to follow). I’m calling this whole process #Inkaday. The constraint is the size.

<p>I know it’s not October anymore, but I had 2 more sketches that I managed to squeeze during the month, which will bring the grand total to 8 inked images for 2014. At the very least I have something to beat for this month. I enjoyed the process enough to continue trying to do a small sketch as often as I can. Even cracked a new notebook just for this purpose.</p>
