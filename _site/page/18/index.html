      <div class="e-content"><p>The main function of a website such as mine is for me to collect things and share them with like minded people.</p>

<p>This year has seen many changes in my life online. After 9 years, I moved my self hosted website away from Dreamhost and onto Tumblr. This was all in service of my removing unwanted distractions. Distractions that would take away from my actually creating something more meaningful.</p>

<p>For nearly 10 years Broken Kode has had it&rsquo;s own custom theme that I&rsquo;ve developed one line of code at a time. This proved to be yet another distraction. It didn&rsquo;t matter what the hell my site looks like. What&rsquo;s important is the content. The custom theme that I&rsquo;ve chosen is extremely servicable and much better than anything I have time to create at the moment.</p>

<p>That isn&rsquo;t to say that I&rsquo;m not creating new websites, just that my personal website is more of a basket for me to put things into. What that basket looks like, ultimately doesn&rsquo;t matter. What matters is what I put in that basket.</p>

What I find truly beautiful about this comic, which is true about most online comics series, is how much better they get from the <a href="http://www.darcomic.com/2004/01/01/whatthefuck/">first page</a>, to the last page.</p>

<p>The transformation is one of the most encouraging things to see as an artist myself, because it humbles you and reminds you that Rome was not built in a day and needed perseverance and that an artist needs to learn and actually maintain their craft.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2013/07/23/the-fifthmode.html">The Fifth Mode</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>Always start with a name. A good name.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have planes, trains, automobiles and boats. What if there was a fifth mode. I have a name for it, called the Hyperloop.<br />
  — Elon Musk</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperloop"><em>Hyperloop</em></a>.</p>

<p>Imagine a world where travelling from San Francisco to Los Angeles takes less than 30 minutes. A method of transportation which is <em>meant</em> to be 4 times as fast as a train, and 2 times as fast as a plane. Now imagine this method of transport is available to you as soon as you arrive — no waiting for everyone else to get there. That’s the future that Elon Musk is proposing with his hypothetical high-speed transportation system. Details for this system are extremely thin on the ground. In fact, apart from the name and a few choice quotes (by Musk himself) nothing substantial has been published or released about the concept;</p>

<p>Although Musk was meant to <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-11/19/elon-musk-on-hyperloop">publish a paper</a> on it back in December 2012. That has now been pushed back to the 12th of August 2013, according to <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/15/4524726/elon-musk-will-reveal-plans-for-hyperloop-august-12th">this tweet</a> by Musk. The Verge has an <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/18/4534476/how-will-elon-musks-hyperloop-work">interesting article</a> on how they believe the system could potentially work.</p>

<p>However until Musk releases his Alpha design documents, there is no real engineering to review.</p>

<hr />
<p>The first time Hyperloop was discussed was in this interview on <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2012/07/12/pandomonthly-presents-a-fireside-chat-with-elon-musk/">Pandodaily</a>, with Sarah Lacy. Based on the little that has been shared, one might think that Musk’s idea will be akin to something like the ‘tube’ transportation system in Futurama or The Jetsons. Many of the ideas (commercial space travel, commercial electric cars) that Musk discusses could have been taken straight out of science fiction novels. The reason you should take these ideas seriously, is because he makes those ideas a reality.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/db6ca643d4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Musk’s idea doesn’t appear to be completely unique (as opposed to the science fictious world). <a href="http://couldthishappen.com/?p=381">Joelle Renstrom</a>, (who teachs at Boston University) has a good breakdown of the realities of this technology. One such reality is the Aeromovel. The other is the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McpWcn-1RZU">Evacuated Tube Transport</a> a system that has been proposed by the <a href="http://www.et3.com/">ET3 consortium</a>. The main question is therefore how does his proposed system differ.</p>

<p>As if the potential of this idea wasn’t intriguing enough; the way that Musk’s idea could become a reality is equally as intriguing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m considering just open-sourcing. Describing the idea, saying this is what would be done, if someone wants to do it then they could do it. Maybe I should patent it and open-source the patent to anyone who can make a credible case that they can do it.<br />
  — Elon Musk</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it’s safe to acknowledge that Elon Musk sees the world in a different way to most people. Probably one of the best articles I’ve read about him, is unsurprisingly on <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-09-13/elon-musk-the-21st-century-industrialist">Bloomberg</a>. Between commercial space travel, electric cars and pneumatic transportation, he is building the future that we were expecting. The future we dreamed we would be living in, when we got older.</p>
