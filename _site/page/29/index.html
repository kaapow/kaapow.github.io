      <div class="e-content"><p>Image Comics is now allowing you to keep the digital copies of the comics you buy from them - about bloody time. What&rsquo;s also incredibly interesting however is the percentage of the sales that the digital copies account for the overall sales of the publisher. Last year it was 12%, this year they&rsquo;re projecting 15%.</p>

<p>Will the digital percentage ever surpass the actual physical monthly books? I think this is inevitable and actually a great thing for the creators. The main point is to put the books in the hands of people that want to read them (and pay for them) regardless of the format.</p>

<p>I stopped buying monthly comic books years ago. However I would definitely consider buying digital comics and then a trade collection if the art, story and overall package warranted it.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>When Karen Berger left Vertigo comics it honestly felt like the imprint was in the process of being closed down for good. The months that followed (with little to no new work being announced) only further enforced this view. Today (by way of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/01/business/media/vertigo-a-dc-comics-brand-is-rebuilding-with-6-new-series.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;">New York Times</a>), Vertigo fans around the world have reason to rejoice, with the announcement of 6 new series rolling out towards the end of the year.</p>

<p>The stand out books for me are Suiciders (written and drawn by Lee Bermejo), Hinterkind, The Witching Hour and the new Sandman mini series.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>Google has officially killed off it’s Reader product. Like many others, I have been using Google Reader for many years now and so have been forced to look for an alternative. Thankfully developers all over the world responded to this (stupid) business decision(?) and provided a slew of alternatives. There really is a great deal of choice, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p>My preferred solution is probably a reasonably popular one, in that I’m using <a href="http://Feedbin.me">Feedbin</a> as my backend. This connects to <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> on iOS and <a href="http://readkitapp.com/">Readkit</a> on my Mac. One of the <em>main</em> reasons for choosing Feedbin however is linked to the excellent implementation of the website which is incredibly slick (I need this, as my work machine is Windows based).</p>

<p>The thing that definitely made me smile however is just how quickly the developer community moved to provide good alternatives that lost nothing from the features provided by Google Reader and in fact held more promise than the stagnant Reader.</p>

<p>Although the RSS feed reader market is ‘old’, it’s a completely nascent one - which means that the best is yet to come.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2013/06/02/its-me-not.html">It's me, not you</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>This week I learnt a very clear lesson in what appears to work on Tumblr.</p>

<p>I &lsquo;relaunched&rsquo; Broken Kode with an all new number 1 post, around 3 months ago. I decided to keep a razor sharp focus on Tesla news and engineering in general. The model I was trying to on Daring Fireball - not a terribly original idea admittedly but I thought that as time would go on the site would evolve or die based on its own success and failure.</p>

<p>In those 3 months I honestly saw extremely limited traction of people visiting the site, reblogging or liking a post. In fact a total of 3 people actually follow the site - hi guys, thanks for following. Then earlier this week I posted my first image. That single post has generated more action than the entire site has had in the 3 months since the relaunch.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an 'event&rsquo; that I can&rsquo;t ignore, as clearly I&rsquo;m not reaching the desired audience on Tumblr - which I know exists. What I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s me, not you. Tumblr knows what it is. The users know what they want out of Tumblr; I however thought that I could use the platform in a different way. The platform is clearly suited to a specific kind of content, one which isn&rsquo;t text heavy.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>Coda Automotive filed for bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t feel bad, I didn&rsquo;t know who they were either. What brought the company to my attention was the fact that their name was mentioned along side both Tesla and Fisker, as an equal in the electric vehicle revolution.</p>

<p>I looked around to try and understand the reasons for the company&rsquo;s demise. A quick search online and found a picture of its flagship product, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coda_(electric_car)">Coda</a>. Yeah, exactly what I thought, pretty damn fugly. Clearly I wasn&rsquo;t alone as the company <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-05-01/demise-of-coda-automotive-means-lonelier-electric-car-owners">sold 100 cars in total</a>.</p>

<p>What amuses me about the comparisons to Tesla, is how misguided and wrong those comparisons actually are. Sure they both make (or in Coda&rsquo;s case, <em>made</em>) electric cars, but that&rsquo;s as far as I could see the similarities ending.</p>

<p>People who&rsquo;ve never seen a Model S in real person, lust after it. Tesla make a single vehicle at the moment. They&rsquo;ve stopped production on the Roadster and the focus is on a single product. They are focusing on this model and increasing it&rsquo;s appeal - through continuous initiatives such as it&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/true-cost-of-ownership">leasing programme</a> and expanded <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/supercharger">supercharger network</a>. Companies like Coda, made 100 lemons.</p>

<p>The proposed solution for the limited range the batteries will offer is to have multiple cars per driver, per race. Each race lasts for 1 hour. The first car is used for 20 minutes, a second car is then used for the next 20 minutes, before returning to the first car (where the batteries have been recharged) for the final 20 minutes. The hope that 10 additional minutes are added per year to the range of the vehicles.</p>

<p>Formula 1 is the pinnacle of Motorsport. From this racing series, hundreds of (small and large) innovations have been added to road cars, as the teams fight for a competitive advantage and therefore innovate like crazy. Hopefully the Formula E series can do the same thing for Electric Vehicles and battery technology.</p>
