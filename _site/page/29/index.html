      <div class="e-content"><p>There was a time in my life where I remember that I resented change. It was something that I later came to understand was actually a major component of life. Major change can either come in regular doses, or can wait dormantly, in the shadows for years. </p>

<p>Change is <em>everywhere</em> at the moment. </p>

<p>We’re gearing up for our first baby’s imminent arrival, which has honestly completely consumed our every free moment. </p>

<p>At work, yesterday was Naresh and Max’s last day onsite. I sat next to Naresh for the last 2 years as we saw the building go from a hole in the ground to something much, much more. We’ve effectively been in the ‘trenches’ together (at least the engineering/construction trenches) and while we’ve not come out unscratched, I think we’ve both learnt an incredible amount, from each other.</p>

<p>Don’t fight change. Embrace it. Life will be easier that way.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>I missed this.</p>

<p>For 10 years I&rsquo;ve published to the internet through <a href="http://www.brokenkode.com">Broken Kode</a>. These last few years that site has meandered a great deal, but has now finally settled down to a very focused topic, which ironically is what is was always intended in the first place, namely a process site for my comic book and creative work.</p>

<p>Although I intend to rebrand it (and therefore discontinue the name that has held up for 10 years), I think the change will be a <em>positive one</em>.</p>

<p>This site (<a href="http://khaledaboualfa.co">khaledaboualfa.co</a>) is wearing it&rsquo;s heart on it&rsquo;s sleeve. There will likely be little focus, which is actually by design. My intention is to give myself the room and space to express myself and my thoughts freely and comment on any topic that happens to capture my imagination at the time. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll get some people to stay for the ride.</p>

<p>Like I said I missed <em>this</em>.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2014/04/17/process.html">Process</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>A few months after publishing the last episode of <em>Moon Racket</em> Season One, I&rsquo;ve now finished writing the second season. If the first season was all about seeing a project through to completion, the second season is taking the idea and adding some polish.</p>

<p>One of the things I&rsquo;ve always enjoy watching is the natural maturing process a body of work sometimes goes through while the creative minds behind the work hone their skills. Although I can only dream of reaching the lofty heights reached by a series like <em>The Simpsons</em>, an apt comparison in one regard would be how the first season looked compared to what we recognise as the characters now. There was a maturing process and this is something that I aim to achieve for Season Two, both for the writing and the art.</p>

<hr />
<p>I&rsquo;ve already spoken about the proposed increase in paper size (and therefore <a href="http://brokenkode.com/post/78836757301/panel-size">Panel Size</a>) of the coming season. One thing I realised very quickly was just how important the initial scripts were. The first season had a bit of looseness in the scripts. I would often times rewrite the thing as I was drawing it - sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>For this season I decided to really pour into the details of every script. I would not go on to the next one until I actually had completed the one I was working on. If I got stuck on any one strip, I would remove it from the document I was working on and paste it into a second document that acted as my &lsquo;graveyard&rsquo;. This allowed me to focus on one strip at a time. What I realised was that some ideas took days, weeks to mature or develop in my head and other ideas effectively wrote themselves. What I also realised was the last 5 episodes were extremely difficult to complete, which might have been a mental block on my side, or the fact that I had a lot going on in my life at the time.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2014/03/07/panel-sizes.html">Panel Sizes</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p><em>Moon Racket</em> started out life on my iPhone 4. It was a method for me to actually use my latest &lsquo;computer&rsquo; to create content, rather than just consume on it.</p>

<p>The obvious limitation was the size of the screen, so I decided to use this as the panel size (or at least the same aspect ratio 3:2) with the idea that eventually when I release the series digitally, it will already be formatted for this screen size.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/15527be017.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I realised pretty quickly that although I was getting the benefit of colour and I was using my iPhone, the creation process was stifling and the end result wasn&rsquo;t as consistent as I would have liked. I decided to take the strip back to the physical world and made the investment in an A4 hardcover art book with thick paper - no idea what the grade is, but it was reasonably smooth (not bristol board smooth). It was one of the best decisions I&rsquo;ve made. All of <em>Moon Racket</em> lives in this A4 book.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/417fa9555f.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Traditionally the newspaper industry and therefore the artform itself, comic strips are typically 4 panels, 4 inches by 3 inches. In an attempt to grow, Season Two will be framed with the typical 3:4 ratio panels. I&rsquo;ve had to get some American sized paper, 11x14 inches, which frustratingly is slightly larger than A4 but smaller than A3 - and means I can no longer use my A4 book.</p>

<p>Hopefully this change will mean that the art will breathe more and therefore should allow the strip to better shine.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2014/01/26/season-one-report.html">Season One Report Card</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>Today marks 20 consecutive weeks that I&rsquo;ve published a new episode for my online comic <a href="http://moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a>, so I thought it would be nice to take stock and review the experience.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/ae9a7dd334.jpg" alt="" /><strong>All 20 strips in a nice overview image.</strong></p>

<p>Rather than being completely harsh (which would come easily for me when reviewing my own work), I think I&rsquo;ll first highlight some of the things that I thought went well.</p>

<p>Firstly, the strip never missed a ship date. All 20 episodes were released every Sunday for 20 weeks. Secondly, the general reaction on both <a href="http://facebook.com/moonracket">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://moonracket.com">Tumblr</a> have been really great and I&rsquo;m grateful to everyone who has liked, shared or read the strip. I&rsquo;m still debating whether or not <a href="http://tapastic.com/series/moonracket">Tapastic</a> is worth it, but I do it for the 3 that have subscribed and hopefully enjoying the strip.</p>

<p>Overall, I give the strips an overall <strong>5/10</strong>. There are some stories that I think worked out better than others but the truth is I could have written better stories and could have developed the characters better.</p>

<p>One aspect that I am genuinely happy with is the <em>evolution</em> of the artwork. I still think it&rsquo;s ok and only the errors jump out at me, but at least I can see a proper improvement over the life of the strip.</p>

<p>With that in mind the series is going to take a break for a few months while I write better stories (currently I have 10 in the bag) and come back stronger with Season Two.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2014/01/13/inking-tools.html">Inking Tools</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>In early 2012 I started work on my first iOS app with my cousin. The trip was long and meandering (one which unfortunately we never completed).</p>

<p>One of the things that I made sure I did was keep all my notes and scribbles in a single notebook. This was a bit of a departure for me, but one that I have maintained for all my future projects. Each project has it&rsquo;s own notebook where most things can be found.</p>

<p>One sketch that I attribute the inking of <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a> to, is the original icon sketch for the app.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/2bd6f881a3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The importance of this sketch was in making me appreciate the Muji 0.38mm black gel ink pen as a tool for clean inking and providing the correct thickness of line that I was originally looking for - but couldn&rsquo;t really achieve with my Copic pens.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/a6e0e965e6.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>While this pen isn&rsquo;t completely suitable for the clean lined artwork of <em>Chroma</em>, it still has it&rsquo;s uses for all the cross-hatching required. Sometimes you stumble on a tool that elevates your art, for me it was my Muji gel ink pen.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>When you reflect back on a year, the hope is always to find a number of moments that put a smile on your face - thankfully these last 12 months have given me with a lot to smile about.</p>

<p>Getting the news that I am going to become a father was the definite highlight - a fact which I’ve honestly not wrapped my head completely around, but I’ve started preparing<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Creatively this year is one of my strongest in recent memory. I drew an entire season of <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a>, a slew of additional promotional images and designed the website - although it’s going to get some redesign love in the new year. Surprisingly the comic work didn’t end there as I completely rewrote the script for <em>Chroma</em> (my upcoming comics project) that has been many years in the making.</p>

<p>I redesigned this here site for the umpteenth time, however I do believe that this iteration is by far my most mature attempt and probably one that I will likely not change fundamentally for many years to come. The aspects of the site that I am most happy with are the colours and the typography, which is the first time in many years that I am ahead of the curve in certain respects (small caps only valid in certain browsers, surprisingly not Safari/Webkit proper).</p>

<p>Finally I started work on two iOS apps. The first one, we’ve scrapped and shelved, the other I hope we get some traction in the new year and we finally ship something, because as we all know:</p>
