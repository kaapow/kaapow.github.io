		<h1><a href="/2013/07/23/the-fifthmode.html">The Fifth Mode</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>Always start with a name. A good name.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have planes, trains, automobiles and boats. What if there was a fifth mode. I have a name for it, called the Hyperloop.<br />
  — Elon Musk</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperloop"><em>Hyperloop</em></a>.</p>

<p>Imagine a world where travelling from San Francisco to Los Angeles takes less than 30 minutes. A method of transportation which is <em>meant</em> to be 4 times as fast as a train, and 2 times as fast as a plane. Now imagine this method of transport is available to you as soon as you arrive — no waiting for everyone else to get there. That’s the future that Elon Musk is proposing with his hypothetical high-speed transportation system. Details for this system are extremely thin on the ground. In fact, apart from the name and a few choice quotes (by Musk himself) nothing substantial has been published or released about the concept;</p>

<p>Although Musk was meant to <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-11/19/elon-musk-on-hyperloop">publish a paper</a> on it back in December 2012. That has now been pushed back to the 12th of August 2013, according to <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/15/4524726/elon-musk-will-reveal-plans-for-hyperloop-august-12th">this tweet</a> by Musk. The Verge has an <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/18/4534476/how-will-elon-musks-hyperloop-work">interesting article</a> on how they believe the system could potentially work.</p>

<p>However until Musk releases his Alpha design documents, there is no real engineering to review.</p>

<hr />
<p>The first time Hyperloop was discussed was in this interview on <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2012/07/12/pandomonthly-presents-a-fireside-chat-with-elon-musk/">Pandodaily</a>, with Sarah Lacy. Based on the little that has been shared, one might think that Musk’s idea will be akin to something like the ‘tube’ transportation system in Futurama or The Jetsons. Many of the ideas (commercial space travel, commercial electric cars) that Musk discusses could have been taken straight out of science fiction novels. The reason you should take these ideas seriously, is because he makes those ideas a reality.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/db6ca643d4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Musk’s idea doesn’t appear to be completely unique (as opposed to the science fictious world). <a href="http://couldthishappen.com/?p=381">Joelle Renstrom</a>, (who teachs at Boston University) has a good breakdown of the realities of this technology. One such reality is the Aeromovel. The other is the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McpWcn-1RZU">Evacuated Tube Transport</a> a system that has been proposed by the <a href="http://www.et3.com/">ET3 consortium</a>. The main question is therefore how does his proposed system differ.</p>

<p>As if the potential of this idea wasn’t intriguing enough; the way that Musk’s idea could become a reality is equally as intriguing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m considering just open-sourcing. Describing the idea, saying this is what would be done, if someone wants to do it then they could do it. Maybe I should patent it and open-source the patent to anyone who can make a credible case that they can do it.<br />
  — Elon Musk</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it’s safe to acknowledge that Elon Musk sees the world in a different way to most people. Probably one of the best articles I’ve read about him, is unsurprisingly on <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-09-13/elon-musk-the-21st-century-industrialist">Bloomberg</a>. Between commercial space travel, electric cars and pneumatic transportation, he is building the future that we were expecting. The future we dreamed we would be living in, when we got older.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>Image Comics is now allowing you to keep the digital copies of the comics you buy from them - about bloody time. What&rsquo;s also incredibly interesting however is the percentage of the sales that the digital copies account for the overall sales of the publisher. Last year it was 12%, this year they&rsquo;re projecting 15%.</p>

<p>Will the digital percentage ever surpass the actual physical monthly books? I think this is inevitable and actually a great thing for the creators. The main point is to put the books in the hands of people that want to read them (and pay for them) regardless of the format.</p>

<p>I stopped buying monthly comic books years ago. However I would definitely consider buying digital comics and then a trade collection if the art, story and overall package warranted it.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>There was a time in the early 2000s, before Twitter was a thing, before Facebook was open to anyone but University students, when the Internet was a smaller place, or at least if felt like it.</p>

<p>There was a time when communicating was easy, and your voice could be heard (amongst the cacophony around you), even if it was faint and fleeting.</p>

<p>There was a time when blogging was being part of a community. There was a time, which now is gone.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>Google has officially killed off it’s Reader product. Like many others, I have been using Google Reader for many years now and so have been forced to look for an alternative. Thankfully developers all over the world responded to this (stupid) business decision(?) and provided a slew of alternatives. There really is a great deal of choice, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p>My preferred solution is probably a reasonably popular one, in that I’m using <a href="http://Feedbin.me">Feedbin</a> as my backend. This connects to <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> on iOS and <a href="http://readkitapp.com/">Readkit</a> on my Mac. One of the <em>main</em> reasons for choosing Feedbin however is linked to the excellent implementation of the website which is incredibly slick (I need this, as my work machine is Windows based).</p>

<p>The thing that definitely made me smile however is just how quickly the developer community moved to provide good alternatives that lost nothing from the features provided by Google Reader and in fact held more promise than the stagnant Reader.</p>

<p>Although the RSS feed reader market is ‘old’, it’s a completely nascent one - which means that the best is yet to come.</p>
