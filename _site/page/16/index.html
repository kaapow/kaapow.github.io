      <div class="e-content"><p>When you reflect back on a year, the hope is always to find a number of moments that put a smile on your face - thankfully these last 12 months have given me with a lot to smile about.</p>

<p>Getting the news that I am going to become a father was the definite highlight - a fact which I’ve honestly not wrapped my head completely around, but I’ve started preparing<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Creatively this year is one of my strongest in recent memory. I drew an entire season of <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a>, a slew of additional promotional images and designed the website - although it’s going to get some redesign love in the new year. Surprisingly the comic work didn’t end there as I completely rewrote the script for <em>Chroma</em> (my upcoming comics project) that has been many years in the making.</p>

<p>I redesigned this here site for the umpteenth time, however I do believe that this iteration is by far my most mature attempt and probably one that I will likely not change fundamentally for many years to come. The aspects of the site that I am most happy with are the colours and the typography, which is the first time in many years that I am ahead of the curve in certain respects (small caps only valid in certain browsers, surprisingly not Safari/Webkit proper).</p>

<p>Finally I started work on two iOS apps. The first one, we’ve scrapped and shelved, the other I hope we get some traction in the new year and we finally ship something, because as we all know:</p>

<p>Earlier this year I completed rewriting the script I have been working on for many years now. I originally conceived of the idea in my 20s. Now in my early/mid-30s I&rsquo;ve finally completed the works in a fashion that I believe I can actually start making some progress on this idea by drawing it and eventually publishing it.</p>

<p>Although it&rsquo;s never the tools that make the end product, the right tools remove unnecessary friction. In this regard, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/highland/id499329572">Highland</a> has been an irreplaceable solution for creating scripts. I thoroughly recommend it to all script (and non-script) writers.</p>

<h2>Lettering</h2>

<p>In creating <a href="http://moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a>, it was very clear to me early on that the lettering would have to be a character in itself. My initial attempts at lettering involved hand lettering, in the end I opted for some great fonts from the <a href="http://comicraft.com">Comicraft</a> library.</p>

<p>In early 2012 I was working on an app for iOS with my cousin. The second company name we came up with was Codanauts. I loved the name and came up with this logo over a weekend. 2 months later my cousin found out about <a href="http://www.codenauts.com">Codenauts</a>. There is a subtle difference if you missed it: Cod-a-nauts vs Cod-e-nauts.</p>

<p>Oddly enough they seem to have stopped their operation and our operation never took off. I still love the similicity of this logo and hope to use it in the future.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>Earlier this year I contemplated shutting down Broken Kode, a site that has been part of the internet landscape since January 2004, a total of nearly 10 years online. In a last attempt to keep the name and the site alive I tried changing things around to see if I could maintain my enthusiasm for it.</p>

<p>My first attempt was to try and focus on all things Tesla Motors. However I quickly realised that actually I was writing to an audience of one (myself) and that I wasn’t enjoying the process all that much. My next idea was to use the site as a simple Tumblr, a digital drawer for things that others created. My attempts can still be read <a href="http://khaledaboualfa.tumblr.com">here</a>.</p>

<p>Ultimately I felt that the site deserved better treatment. In the last few months I have started publishing my comic work, on <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a> and I have several other projects in the pipeline as well. So this site will be used as a way to log my ideas and showcase the creative process, in the attempt to better understand what I am doing and how I could be doing it better. The posts on this site will be more limited, however each and every one will be infinitely more <em>personal</em>.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2013/11/02/weight.html">Weight</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>Since I got married (nearly 3 years ago) I&rsquo;ve put on around 10kg (around 1.5 stone or 22 pounds). Yeah that&rsquo;s a lot. I don&rsquo;t blame my lovely wife for this additional weight, but rather a combination of my lifestyle in the Middle East (very little required movement) and my body&rsquo;s very slow metabolism.</p>

<p>Earlier this year I decided that enough was enough and that I would do something about this situation. Apart from general health issues associated with gaining the above weight, by wardrobe is useless, which then affects my general comfort/confidence levels as well.</p>

<h3>Proof of Concept</h3>

<p>Like any self respecting geek, I turned to my trustiest device to help me out, my iPhone 4. I tried several fitness apps, but settled on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pacer-pedometer-plus-weight/id600446812?mt=8">Pacer</a> app. While not the prettiest app, it gave me basic information, the number of steps I was making and calories burned, in graph form, mapped over a week.</p>

<p>I realised that having this information drove me to be more active. I have yet to achieve 10,000 steps a day. I average anywhere between 6000-8000 steps per week, however I realised that the exercise that I was doing was not being logged properly. My gym machines indicated a much higher level of activity, that my phone wasn&rsquo;t capturing.</p>

<h3>All the Gear…</h3>

<p>I decided to get a little bit more serious about this weight loss malarky. There was one thing to it, buy more gadgets that would help me achieve my goals, <em>obviously</em>.</p>

<p>The first accessory that I bought was a pair of sweat proof earphones - I cannot tell you how many Apple earbuds I&rsquo;ve destroyed due to my excessive sweating over the years. The Sennheiser OCX 685i Sports headphones came <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-exercise-headphones/">highly recommended</a> (and they are great).</p>

<p>The next purchase was my <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/uk/one">Fitbit One</a>. The truth is I didn&rsquo;t jump into this world quickly. I used the Pacer app for a solid 2 months before making the jump into the Fitbit world. I&rsquo;m still getting to grips with the website and the app (although syncing with my current setup isn&rsquo;t as smooth as it could be <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup> ), but I like what I see so far.</p>

<p>The last part of my gear was a new set of scales. Actually, I&rsquo;ve not owned scales in 3 years, which probably explains a great deal for the general decent into obesity. So here&rsquo;s a tip kids, make sure you own scales and get on them once a week. If anything it will highlight things that you&rsquo;re generally scared of.</p>

<p>I hope that the data that I compile will help me make better decisions in the kitchen (after all a diet starts in the kitchen) and that it will motivate me to be more active, more regularly, even if only a little more every day.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<hr /><ol><li id="fn:1">
<p>The biggest bummer is that my trusted iPhone 4 since it does not support wireless sync with the Fitbit One. I&rsquo;m therefore relegated to using the little dongle connected to my computer - hardly the biggest hardship. <a href="1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>Maintaining focus with your side projects is a difficult task. Life doesn’t always give you all the time and space to do this at your leisure, then again life doesn’t owe you anything and it’s up to you to use the time that you do have available wisely.</p>

<p>Currently I am publishing <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a> weekly and have finished writing the script for my next project. Work on the new project is going well, as I’ve also managed to draw the first couple of pages of this series, with the hope of actually publishing it at the start of the new year - also on a weekly publishing programme.</p>

<p>I sometimes lament the time that’s come and gone that I could have used to create the art and words; however the main problem was understanding that sometimes you have to take the plunge, create something (even if it’s not up the standard that you want it to be), with the understanding that the more you do something, the better you eventually become at it.</p>
