		<h1><a href="/2016/06/25/starts.html">Starts</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>You have to start somewhere. Creativity is borne oftentimes of <strong>constraint</strong>. While this is something that has been talked about, finding your own constraints is actually much harder to do in practice.</p>

<p>I’ve always wanted to maintain a voice on the internet. Back in 2004, blogging and the community that surrounded that activity on the internet was an extremely exciting and vibrant. I desperately wanted to be a part of what was happening. The problem was that after I exhausted the initial ideas (which to be fair took years to exhaust) I didn’t really find my voice. The options available to me were limitless…and that was the problem.</p>

<h2>What’s in a name</h2>

<p>This isn’t the first time I’ve used the term <em>Cerebral Interviews</em>. In my first website, from back in 2004, it was the very first category or tag that I used to describe the general noise that was flowing in my head.</p>

<p>I then tried to use that same term for a newsletter that I ran for a year. The newsletter had a bunch of links and commentary that would be published once a month. It was mainly sent through to my friends and family and received approximately 0% engagement from anyone on the list. Hardly a roaring success but it allowed me to get somethings off my chest.</p>

<p>What I’ve realised is that actually although I love design in general, it distracts me from the actual creative work. I will miss the fun that I’ve had learning HTML/CSS/PHP (I could never wrap my head around Javascript for some reason), but I need to add enough constraints that will allow me to produce more regularly.</p>

<p>Design can now be constrained to the images and stuff that surround the work that I publish, rather than the vessel in which they’re delivered to. Medium has my back.</p>

<h2>The Product</h2>

<p>Which brings me to the actual content at hand. What’s the point of my existing online. Why not limit my output to links and commentary on my Twitter and Instagram accounts? There’s also all the work that goes into producing <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket!</a>?</p>

<p>Twitter doesn’t allow me to craft an article, or publish comics with the inherent presentation that is available at my fingertips on <em>Medium</em>. Having a platform ready to go will allow me to concentrate on the task at hand and actually just finish pages and publish them is an important one for me.</p>

<p>By publishing here, the amount of fiddling available to me is constrained and that will hopefully help me to focus on the final products.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2016/05/02/giving-up.html">Giving Up</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>I’m not sure when it happened exactly, but somewhere along the way, I just gave up creating and giving a shit about <em>creating</em> for the internet. I gave up following comic books in a semi-religious manner. I gave up playing basketball every single week. I gave up watching movies regularly. I gave up writing to my various website.</p>

<p>My aim has always been to create a <em>small</em> library of stories that I’ve written and drawn that are available in a multitude of formats (from digital to paperbacks and hardcovers). It’s a reasonably modest aim, but with the option of becoming greater depending on scale.</p>

<p>Do I think that this library of stories will provide me with a living? Probably not, unless I have some serious success somewhere and hit on the zeitgeist in a way that I can neither predict nor anticipate. So I’ll be content to having a series of books with my name on the spine and that finally put to paper the ideas in my head.</p>

<h2>Little strokes fell great oaks</h2>

<p>I’m clear that for the time being I will not have hours and hours to my name. I can however carve 30 minutes in the morning and 30 minutes in the evening and effectively do 2 pomodoros. High burst sets of 30 minutes pieces of work. That’s 7 hours a week. That’s 364 hours a year. If I spend 10 hours per page that equates to 36.4 pages of story and art. If I manage to do a page of art a week, then I’ll be able to do around 50 pages a year. The size of a European album.</p>

<p>The numbers don’t lie. It all starts with 2 pomodoros every single day. The issue however is life getting in the way. Sometimes you’re extremely tired. Sometimes the boy doesn’t sleep. Sometimes I have a business trip or I’m not feeling up for it. This is only natural. The difficulty is finding a way to get back into the routine. Routines are hard won and easily lost.</p>

<h2>Deadlines</h2>

<p>The last piece of the puzzle. I have about 8 projects that are not really linked with each other floating at different stages of development. I need to stop the <a href="http://elitedaily.com/money/entrepreneurship/addicted-ideas-give-brain-crack-go/">braincrack</a> from spreading and destroying my flow.</p>

<p>So I’ll be dedicating 1 year to any of these projects. That gives them enough time to mature. Of course if I’m close to finishing any of the projects then I’ll continue till I finish, but if I’m completely off, then that one gets parked and I move onto the next one.</p>

<p>So as a way to keep track, 2015 was mainly <a href="http://moonracket.com">Moon Racket!</a> and will extend to the end of 2016. After 2016, I will stop work on this series (unless it’s exploded) and then move onto the next project.</p>

<p>This all begins tomorrow morning - I’ll be back regularly to discuss progress.</p>
