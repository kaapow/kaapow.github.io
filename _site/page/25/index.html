		<h1><a href="/2014/03/07/panel-sizes.html">Panel Sizes</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p><em>Moon Racket</em> started out life on my iPhone 4. It was a method for me to actually use my latest &lsquo;computer&rsquo; to create content, rather than just consume on it.</p>

<p>The obvious limitation was the size of the screen, so I decided to use this as the panel size (or at least the same aspect ratio 3:2) with the idea that eventually when I release the series digitally, it will already be formatted for this screen size.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/15527be017.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I realised pretty quickly that although I was getting the benefit of colour and I was using my iPhone, the creation process was stifling and the end result wasn&rsquo;t as consistent as I would have liked. I decided to take the strip back to the physical world and made the investment in an A4 hardcover art book with thick paper - no idea what the grade is, but it was reasonably smooth (not bristol board smooth). It was one of the best decisions I&rsquo;ve made. All of <em>Moon Racket</em> lives in this A4 book.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/417fa9555f.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Traditionally the newspaper industry and therefore the artform itself, comic strips are typically 4 panels, 4 inches by 3 inches. In an attempt to grow, Season Two will be framed with the typical 3:4 ratio panels. I&rsquo;ve had to get some American sized paper, 11x14 inches, which frustratingly is slightly larger than A4 but smaller than A3 - and means I can no longer use my A4 book.</p>

<p>Hopefully this change will mean that the art will breathe more and therefore should allow the strip to better shine.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2014/01/26/season-one-report.html">Season One Report Card</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>Today marks 20 consecutive weeks that I&rsquo;ve published a new episode for my online comic <a href="http://moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a>, so I thought it would be nice to take stock and review the experience.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/ae9a7dd334.jpg" alt="" /><strong>All 20 strips in a nice overview image.</strong></p>

<p>Rather than being completely harsh (which would come easily for me when reviewing my own work), I think I&rsquo;ll first highlight some of the things that I thought went well.</p>

<p>Firstly, the strip never missed a ship date. All 20 episodes were released every Sunday for 20 weeks. Secondly, the general reaction on both <a href="http://facebook.com/moonracket">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://moonracket.com">Tumblr</a> have been really great and I&rsquo;m grateful to everyone who has liked, shared or read the strip. I&rsquo;m still debating whether or not <a href="http://tapastic.com/series/moonracket">Tapastic</a> is worth it, but I do it for the 3 that have subscribed and hopefully enjoying the strip.</p>

<p>Overall, I give the strips an overall <strong>5/10</strong>. There are some stories that I think worked out better than others but the truth is I could have written better stories and could have developed the characters better.</p>

<p>One aspect that I am genuinely happy with is the <em>evolution</em> of the artwork. I still think it&rsquo;s ok and only the errors jump out at me, but at least I can see a proper improvement over the life of the strip.</p>

<p>With that in mind the series is going to take a break for a few months while I write better stories (currently I have 10 in the bag) and come back stronger with Season Two.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>In early 2012 I started work on my first iOS app with my cousin. The trip was long and meandering (one which unfortunately we never completed).</p>

<p>One of the things that I made sure I did was keep all my notes and scribbles in a single notebook. This was a bit of a departure for me, but one that I have maintained for all my future projects. Each project has it&rsquo;s own notebook where most things can be found.</p>

<p>One sketch that I attribute the inking of <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a> to, is the original icon sketch for the app.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/2bd6f881a3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The importance of this sketch was in making me appreciate the Muji 0.38mm black gel ink pen as a tool for clean inking and providing the correct thickness of line that I was originally looking for - but couldn&rsquo;t really achieve with my Copic pens.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/a6e0e965e6.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>While this pen isn&rsquo;t completely suitable for the clean lined artwork of <em>Chroma</em>, it still has it&rsquo;s uses for all the cross-hatching required. Sometimes you stumble on a tool that elevates your art, for me it was my Muji gel ink pen.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>When you reflect back on a year, the hope is always to find a number of moments that put a smile on your face - thankfully these last 12 months have given me with a lot to smile about.</p>

<p>Getting the news that I am going to become a father was the definite highlight - a fact which I’ve honestly not wrapped my head completely around, but I’ve started preparing<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Creatively this year is one of my strongest in recent memory. I drew an entire season of <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a>, a slew of additional promotional images and designed the website - although it’s going to get some redesign love in the new year. Surprisingly the comic work didn’t end there as I completely rewrote the script for <em>Chroma</em> (my upcoming comics project) that has been many years in the making.</p>

<p>I redesigned this here site for the umpteenth time, however I do believe that this iteration is by far my most mature attempt and probably one that I will likely not change fundamentally for many years to come. The aspects of the site that I am most happy with are the colours and the typography, which is the first time in many years that I am ahead of the curve in certain respects (small caps only valid in certain browsers, surprisingly not Safari/Webkit proper).</p>

<p>Finally I started work on two iOS apps. The first one, we’ve scrapped and shelved, the other I hope we get some traction in the new year and we finally ship something, because as we all know:</p>

<p>Earlier this year I completed rewriting the script I have been working on for many years now. I originally conceived of the idea in my 20s. Now in my early/mid-30s I&rsquo;ve finally completed the works in a fashion that I believe I can actually start making some progress on this idea by drawing it and eventually publishing it.</p>

<p>Although it&rsquo;s never the tools that make the end product, the right tools remove unnecessary friction. In this regard, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/highland/id499329572">Highland</a> has been an irreplaceable solution for creating scripts. I thoroughly recommend it to all script (and non-script) writers.</p>

<h2>Lettering</h2>

<p>In creating <a href="http://moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a>, it was very clear to me early on that the lettering would have to be a character in itself. My initial attempts at lettering involved hand lettering, in the end I opted for some great fonts from the <a href="http://comicraft.com">Comicraft</a> library.</p>

<p>In early 2012 I was working on an app for iOS with my cousin. The second company name we came up with was Codanauts. I loved the name and came up with this logo over a weekend. 2 months later my cousin found out about <a href="http://www.codenauts.com">Codenauts</a>. There is a subtle difference if you missed it: Cod-a-nauts vs Cod-e-nauts.</p>

<p>Oddly enough they seem to have stopped their operation and our operation never took off. I still love the similicity of this logo and hope to use it in the future.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>Earlier this year I contemplated shutting down Broken Kode, a site that has been part of the internet landscape since January 2004, a total of nearly 10 years online. In a last attempt to keep the name and the site alive I tried changing things around to see if I could maintain my enthusiasm for it.</p>

<p>My first attempt was to try and focus on all things Tesla Motors. However I quickly realised that actually I was writing to an audience of one (myself) and that I wasn’t enjoying the process all that much. My next idea was to use the site as a simple Tumblr, a digital drawer for things that others created. My attempts can still be read <a href="http://khaledaboualfa.tumblr.com">here</a>.</p>

<p>Ultimately I felt that the site deserved better treatment. In the last few months I have started publishing my comic work, on <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a> and I have several other projects in the pipeline as well. So this site will be used as a way to log my ideas and showcase the creative process, in the attempt to better understand what I am doing and how I could be doing it better.
