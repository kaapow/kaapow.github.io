		<h1><a href="/2014/09/07/podcasts.html">Podcasts</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>When I moved to the Middle East at the start of 2010 I used to listen to podcasts usually in the comfort of my home and from my computer. This meant that I actually consumed the programmes sporadically <em>at best</em> and wasn’t a particular follower of any except the odd comic book related podcast.</p>

<p>Sometime around 2011 all of that changed when I got my first (and so far only) iPhone. It’s getting <em>seriously</em> long in the tooth and will be getting an upgrade pretty soon but one of my primary uses on a daily basis is downloading and listening to podcasts.</p>

<p>Two things have come together that have really made the process seamless for me. Background downloads and bluetooth integration with my car.</p>

<p>The last part which is possibly the most important part to come together is the general high quality, diversity and format that many of these podcasts have adopted. Here is my Top 10 current favourites (in actual order of preference):</p>

<p>I didn’t even know that this was a thing until recently. It’s not only a thing, but it’s a beautiful thing. I’m still deciding what cover I should be going for but I definitely know how this little planner will work in my daily routine which has been missing something like this for a while.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2014/08/29/iphone.html">iPhone 4</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>Without a doubt my single most favourite piece of technology of the last 10 years has been my original iPhone 4. It&rsquo;s lived by my side, every day for 4 years straight and been with me as I&rsquo;ve transitions from bacholor, to husband, to father. I created <a href="http://moonracket.com">Corgan and Alfie</a> on there as well.  It&rsquo;s travelled with me to Lebanon, England, Malaysia, Qatar and Greece.</p>

<p>However these last 6 months have been pretty rough. My home button stopped functioning very well (<em>sporadically at best</em>) and as was going to happen eventually, the apps became more optomised for newer hardware which effectively slowed them down on the older hardware.</p>

<p>Having said all that I still use the phone very single day for the following tasks:</p>

<ul><li>Alarm Clock</li>
<li>Podcasts (using <a href="https://overcast.fm">Overcast</a>) every morning before heading off to work. My phone connects to my car via bluetooth <em>of course</em></li>
<li><a href="http://reederapp.com">Reeder</a> for when I&rsquo;m waiting for something</li>
<li>Whatstapp and Messages</li>
<li>Receiving and making phonecalls (I know <strong>shocker</strong>), both the stock app and on Viber and Skype</li>
<li>Safari</li>
<li>Checking my emails (currently using mail.app)</li>
<li>Checking photos of the boy</li>
<li><a href="http://parents2parentsapps.com/soundsleeper/">Sound Sleeper</a> to put the boy to bed</li>
<li>And I&rsquo;ll even throw in a game or 3 (rediscovering the classic <a href="http://www.hexage.net/radiant/">Radiant</a> recently)</li>
</ul>
<p>Not bad for a 4 year old phone. However sometime after the <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/08/28/apple-announces-special-event-for-sept-9/">9th of September</a> that&rsquo;s going to change, following the release of the new iPhone. It honestly could not have come sooner.</p>

<p>The truth is, that while I&rsquo;m still using my phone consistently every day, I&rsquo;ve stopped enjoying using it and one fundamental aspect I have stopped using entirely, that of taking photos.  4 years on, it&rsquo;s really showing it&rsquo;s age in this respect. The camera interface takes a good long time to load and even when it does the pictures are just not that great when compared to my wife&rsquo;s iPhone 5c and certainly not my Sony NEX-F3.</p>

<p>So while the phone has served me incredibly well and for a great long period of time (more than any phone I have ever owned), it&rsquo;s time to say it&rsquo;s swang song and be relegated for the newest and greatest from the minds of Jony Ive and the fine folks a Apple.</p>

<p>There has been a lot of internet chatter about these pencils, enough to have coloured me completely intrigued. Wonderful story by Moisés Chiullan over at <a href="http://imprint.neededition.com/post/95309048215/borrowed-blackwings">Imprint</a>.</p>

<p>These things aren&rsquo;t cheap. They currently retail for $20 for 12 pencils (that&rsquo;s $1.67 per pencil). The box I&rsquo;ve shown above is the <a href="http://palominobrands.com/product/blackwing-grand-piano-box/#product_images%5Bgrouped%5D/0/">grand piano box</a>, which retails for $50 (but I&rsquo;ve not really been able to find one as they seem completely sold out).</p>

<p>The pencil comes in 3 variants. The one recommended for artists is the <a href="http://palominobrands.com/product/palomino-blackwing/">Blackwing</a> (comes in the black colour), although the <a href="http://palominobrands.com/product/palomino-blackwing-602/">602</a> appears to be the general purpose pencil used by all the greats&hellip;</p>

<p>I have been working for <a href="http://www.arup.com">Arup</a> for a combined 10 years (my 10 year anniversary is in September). It&rsquo;s a company who&rsquo;s philosophy and culture I obviously subscribe to (otherwise I wouldn&rsquo;t have been here for this many years).</p>

<p>Trying to capture what I experience every day is hard but I&rsquo;ve always felt that in general the people that are employed by the company also subscribe to this philosophy and culture.</p>

<p>Seeing the early roots of the company captured in this video was extremely special for me, considering how I&rsquo;ve seen the company evolve over these last 10 years and no doubt will evolve even more; it all started however with this <em>eccentric</em> gentleman, the philosopher engineer. Everything is measured from the marker he placed in the ground for future generations to see and measure themselves against.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2014/08/19/greetings-with-a.html">Greetings with a smile</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>A while back (must be over 6 years ago), I remember asking Christos how things were going with his then newborn child Amelia. I&rsquo;d noticed that this tiny little human had mellowed my friend a little and instilled a sense of patience that I had not known him for. One of the take backs from that conversation was him explaining how much work it really was but how the smile and recognition he received from his baby when he arrived home always made his heart melt and washed away all the difficult times.</p>

<p>I remembered this conversation because all these year later I&rsquo;m now experiencing this very thing myself. Sure Zane is little less than 3 months old and he&rsquo;s only recently started giving us his best smile, but it&rsquo;s enough to put all those sleepless, difficult nights, all the nappy changing and scream fests into the rose-tinted past - <em>it wasn&rsquo;t that bad right</em>? <strong>Right</strong>?</p>

<p>No of course it wasn&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>

<p>Sometimes a design comes from behind you and actually surprises you. I knew that I wanted to have a unique design for this site, however I wasn&rsquo;t sure what form it would take or how long it would take me to get there.</p>

<p>One of the main design points is that much of the Tumblr specific posts are &lsquo;hidden&rsquo; (they can all be accessed in the <a href="http://khaledaboualfa.co/archive">archive</a> section), as I wanted the front page to be more about my personal writing rather than the larger image posts. This means expect a great deal more posting in the near future.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2014/08/08/a-lesson.html">A Lesson</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>It&rsquo;s not every day that you get a lesson handed down to you via the internet, while you&rsquo;re still drinking your morning coffee.</p>

<p>Yesterday was a reasonably tough day for me. We finally took Zane out of the house and into the big bad world. We got all the gear, took the nursing cover with us in case he needed to eat while we were out and off we went to the mall (yeah it&rsquo;s August in Qatar, there&rsquo;s precious little else you can do at 2pm in the afternoon).</p>

<p>Everything was fine, until we went into <em>Mamas &amp; Papas</em>. After being nursed in the changing rooms for 20min I was tasked with burping and holding him, and he went MENTAL. Usually pretty good at sorting the boy out, yesterday was not meant to be. After having walked back to the car TWICE,  I had to go back a third time to return something. Baby continued crying and I was just tired at this stage.</p>

<p>Come home and my arm was seriously aching because I&rsquo;ve been holding him looking outwards and my arm is his seat. Mentally, I was tired of this for today. I needed a bit of break, thankfully sleep came easily to both of us.</p>

<hr />
<p>This morning I saw the trailer of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74Cl_KOO-sE">Theory of Everything</a> and it just completely smacked me in the face that I should be genuinely thankful for every single moment I have with the boy and never take it for granted. Ever.</p>

<p>To be clear, I have many examples in my life where fathers cannot be there for their children in one capacity or reason or another - this trailer just gave another example, but reminded me clearly of this fact.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p><img src="http://www.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/8b3d4a958e.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I posted this image on the <em>Moon Racket!</em> <a href="http://twitter.com/moonracket">twitter account</a> (you should follow the account, I talk all things comics there, not just <em>Moon Racket!</em>) yesterday, but I thought it was important to elaborate a little further here.</p>

<p>Basically what you have there is two panels. The first is actually the last panel found in Season One, while the second panel is the first panel for Season Two which I am currently in the process of drawing.</p>

<p>To me the difference couldn&rsquo;t be more stark - it honestly feels like two different people drew these. The difference of course is confidence in the characters, but I&rsquo;ve also changed my tools and the way I&rsquo;m approaching the art in general.</p>

<h3>Tools</h3>

<p>While tools are not the reason for art to be rubbish, the wrong tools can&rsquo;t help the process either. The first thing that&rsquo;s changed is the paper. I&rsquo;ve gone from a reasonable rough yellowy paper in a perfect bound art book to individual cut &ldquo;bristol board&rdquo;-thick A3 sheets. The difference is liberating in that the final panel is hanging off a thick stack of paper underneath it (as it&rsquo;s not part of a book).</p>

<p>The second thing that I&rsquo;ve done is move away from my trusted Copic markers and have moved on to the much cheaper and much better Uni Pin black pigment pens for the thicker pen sizes. I still use my trusted Muji Gel ink pens for all the inking of the standard lines.</p>

<h3>Size Matters</h3>

<p>The last part, that as far as I&rsquo;m concerned has transformed the artwork for me and allowed me to move up a level, is increasing the size of the individual panels. Suddenly I have soo much room to breathe and stretch my artistic muscle.</p>

<h3>Time</h3>

<p>Although Season One was never rushed, I didn&rsquo;t give the pencils enough time to mature. Like a fine wine, pencil work should sit there for a little while to develop in your eyes and allow you to see and correct all the little mistakes. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to redraw entire panels if they&rsquo;re not right. While moving to ink is exciting, leave it for a day, come back to it. Do some more penciling instead.</p>

I’ve used it reasonably diligently over the years, but it’s been one way. Links get put into it, but are hardly every taken out of it.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>The main reason behind this has been the available interfaces for using this particular service have been diabolically rubbish. That includes the native online experience.</p>

<p>Over the years I&rsquo;ve hunted in the App store to find a solution and the available ones felt over-priced and didn&rsquo;t meet my requirements. Enter <a href="http://bananafishsoftware.com/products/spillo/">Spillo</a> by Bananafish Software. Exquisite is the only way to describe this app.</p>

<p>Although there are a plethora of features that I love, my favourite has to be the smart collections. Now at least, when I really don&rsquo;t want to have something that clutters up my Evernote collections, there is a space for it here in Spillo.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2014/07/10/typography.html">Typography</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>Although many will claim that there is still a great deal of work to be done to bring the level of typography in the graphic design and online world forward (and in many respects I agree), I honestly do believe that we live in the start of a golden era for type and the fonts that enable it.</p>

<p>Over the weekend I bought the sublime new font <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mika-melvas/sanelma/">Sanelma</a> from Finnish designer <a href="http://mahti.fi">Mika Melvas</a>. The font itself inspired me to start actual work on a little project I&rsquo;ve had brewing for a while - which is all you can ask from a font before you&rsquo;ve begun using it really.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/172e66ebc9.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This led me down a rabbit hole on all things typography. I realised that a lot of what I enjoy doing and creating relates back to typography in one way or another. My website work is mainly typography, my comic work hangs on the frames created by typography, my day job is revolved around drawings and design which also is very closely related to typography.</p>

<p>Although I <em>was</em> extensively using <a href="https://github.com/adobe/source-sans-pro">Source Sans Pro</a> on all of my three websites, I&rsquo;ve since transitioned things over to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tipotype/libertad/">Libertad</a>, as I felt it gave my sites enough of a unique feel to warrent this transition. The main problem has been in how these fonts are delivered to my Tumblr powered websites (as Myfonts doesn&rsquo;t provide a hosting service like <a href="https://typekit.com/">Typekit</a> or <a href="http://typography.com/">Typography</a> do).</p>

<p><img src="http://www.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/4b4f0070dc.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the one gripe I have with Myfonts. If you&rsquo;re going to make me pay you for a license to use an online font, then provide a service with the cost/overhead of that font. Typekit I believe has the right model, with the basic paid version coming in at a very reasonable $25/year. The main font that I would consider using is <a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/proxima-nova">Proxima Nova</a>. Without fail, every time I see a site using the font, I always instantly go, wait, what&rsquo;s that font? Of course it&rsquo;s <em>Proxima Nova</em>. Just because I don&rsquo;t use it right now, doesn&rsquo;t mean I won&rsquo;t in the future. It is ubiquitous for a reason, it&rsquo;s that good onscreen.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/9b8616ef9e.jpg" alt="Proxima Nova Banner" /></p>

<p>The thing with Typekit however, is that you don&rsquo;t get any of the <a href="http://typography.com/">Hoefler</a> (&amp; <a href="http://frerejones.com/">Frere-Jones</a>) fonts, which I would love. Their fonts are much more expensive to license at $100/year. If I was making $100/year off my websites I would consider it, but alas that&rsquo;s an additional cost I&rsquo;m not that comfortable paying. However I would love to use <a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/ideal-sans/styles/">Ideal Sans</a>.</p>

<p>Take heart, there is now a growing collection of fonts that are amazing to use and either at great prices or for the great price of Free. On my windows machine, <a href="https://01.org/clear-sans">Clear Sans</a> from Intel has honestly been an eye opening experience. With no retina-type displays at work, typography is more painful to appreciate. I&rsquo;ve found that <em>Clear Sans</em> helps in a lot of ways.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/477125df31.jpg" alt="Clear Sans Banner" /></p>

<p>And I haven&rsquo;t even touched upon the great work that is carried out by <a href="http://www.comicraft.com">Comicraft</a>. Most of my comic work uses their fonts, although I do dip my toe into <a href="http://blambot.com">Blambot</a> territory as well.</p>
