      <div class="e-content"><p>While going through my Twitter archive, I realised several things which are going to greatly inform the way I write on the web in the future:</p>

<ol>
  <li>While linklogging is fun, easy and in many ways the fabric that makes up the internet, it’s existence is fleeting. Maybe that link will remain valid for 10 years; or maybe it will last for 6 months. The value is the commentary, opinion or observation and what was important at the time rather than the thing itself. What caught your attention, why should you care, etc.</li>
  <li>The mundane rituals of your life now will seem facinating in 10 years time, because likely those same rituals will have changed, or you’re with someone else, or in a different country. Take a moment to capture your life as it’s playing out now to help trigger some nostalgia further down the road.</li>
  <li>Own your stuff. It’s important because you ultimately control the format that they’re in, now and in the future. <em>I’m looking at you Twitter/Tumblr and your shortening links</em>.</li>
  <li>Once you’re 80% happy with the way your site looks like, move back to writing, photographing, drawing, whatever. Leave the final 20% for slow, purposeful and <em>incremental</em> enhancement.</li>
  <li>If you’re wondering what type of style you should write, take some advice from one of the guys doing it the best (<a href="http://kottke.org">kottke</a>), write as though you’re writing to a friend in an email.</li>
  <li>Who cares about categories and tags.</li>
</ol>

His answer is found across 10 points ; you should watch the video to get a proper explanation on each:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Every day is Groundhog Day</li>
  <li>Build a bliss station</li>
  <li>Forget the noun, do the verb</li>
  <li>Make gifts</li>
  <li>The ordinary + extra attention = the extraordinary</li>
  <li>Art is for life (not the other way around)</li>
  <li>You are allowed to change your mind</li>
  <li>When in doubt, tidy up</li>
  <li>The demons hate fresh air</li>
  <li>Spend time on something that will outlast them</li>
