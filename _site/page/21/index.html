      <div class="e-content"><p><em>What kind of audience do I think <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket!</a> is intended for and how do I reach them?</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been struggling with this question a lot recently, in the lead up to releasing the second season. This then brought up a series of <em>other</em> questions.</p>

<ol><li>What are the topics the series tackles?</li>
<li>Where can I find an audience and declare to them the genius that is <em>Moon Racket!</em>, while not appearing like a <strong>complete</strong> douche bag pimping my shit like a second rate car salesman?</li>
<li>Can I focus on a niche group of people with a specific interest, that would appreciate <em>Moon Racket!</em> and what it has to offer?</li>
<li>Is this series even worth promoting?</li>
</ol>
<p>My intention has always been to create a great strip, that I would like to see myself and I never honestly even considered these questions  when I created the strip. I <em>foolishly</em> expected that between Facebook and Twitter there would be an <em>easy</em> way of marketing my wares. The reality of course is far different and that achieving any traction via social media is reasonably limited (at least for my little webcomic).</p>

<p>In order to try and find different answers and solutions to this question, I&rsquo;ll be tackling this topic in more detail over the coming weeks, reporting on how certain avenues have actually helped the cause.</p>

<p>Continuing this series of posts on the evolution of characters from <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket!</a>, this is first full sketch of Corgan.</p>

<p>What’s facinating to me is just how much information was captured in this one image that I don’t even remember creating. The main features of the character are there, such as the white boots, the shape of the head and the eyes and most importantly the colour palette that was chosen.</p>

<p>The neck reduced in height significantly in later iterations, but this has always been a general favourite sketch of mine because it helped define the world I am trying to create in many subtle ways.</p>

<p>The image that started <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a>.</p>

<p>The incredible part (when you consider the physical and hardware constraints) is that it was all created on an iPhone 4. I’ve written about this before (probably on my now defunct Facebook page), the intention was to create a super <em>simple</em> character that could be easily drawn on that tiny little screen.</p>

<p>As time went on, the character evolved. While I now find him incredibly easy to draw (and can tell instantly when I’ve not done a good job of my lines), that wasn’t always the case.</p>

<p>In fact the first year of Corgan’s life, I wasn’t super comfortable with certain aspects of his drawing him (so much so I remember the very first strip, I thought to trace him as I spent long on the first panel, but quickly realised that I was being stupid and foolish).</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>Traditionally I’ve been a <strong>huge</strong> tinkerer of my websites. Thankfully I turned a leaf last year and decided on a structure and function for each site and only allowed time for enhancing or correcting initial laziness.</p>

<p>For my personal musing site, I recently updated the CSS code to benefit from some of the theme editing functions that Tumblr provides. The whole design of <a href="http://www.aboualfa.tumblr.com">KAA</a> was intentionally completely text based to allow me to have infinite colour combinations.</p>

<p>As a fun experiment, I’ve been taking screenshots of the various colour schemes that I come up with.</p>

<p>Of course, the fact that I’ve not actually written anything meaningful on there for 5 months begs the question of why the design is even relevant, I’m just glad it’s there for when I <strong>eventually</strong> pull my finger out.</p>

<p>This is one of the first images I ever drew using blue pencil lead instead of standard graphite. It’s also one of the first images that shows all the recent iterations of the characters are located in one image.</p>

<p>This image however was done pretty quickly (over an evening in fact, pencil to ink) and was meant to be a way of flexing my muscles. I didn’t even know what the characters were saying to each other (or why). You can read the final strip <a href="http://moonracket.com/post/117317667409/season-two-teaser">here</a>.</p>

<p>My biggest error (and I don’t know how it got through) was Woz’s stamp, where the perspective is all wrong. Sometime you just need a simple idea, which lets your pencil move - what you sacrifice for this freedom of movement is that the end result might not be as polished as you would hope.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>There is much to like about Tumblr and publishing on Tumblr. There are however some constraints that I have been trying to work my way through. <em>High resolution</em> images on Tumblr are constrained in size to 1280px for normal high res photos and 2560x500px for panorama photos.</p>

<p>The problem is that Moon Racket strips don&rsquo;t really fall into either category. I could potentially use the panorama photos setting, but that would mean making things fit into a 500px height (which isn&rsquo;t great). Here&rsquo;s a look of what the panorma would look like using the <a href="http://moonracket.com/post/119418092109/in-plain-sight">latest weekly</a> (which dropped yesterday):</p>

<p><img src="http://www.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/a59360f369.jpg" alt="Panorama" /></p>

<p>Alternatively I could upload the image as 1280px. On a retina display that works out to be a 640px image (which honestly is tiny). My website allows for a 960px width - on a retina display that&rsquo;s 1920px. If I do let Tumblr do it&rsquo;s thing, then my crisp black lines that I&rsquo;ve worked long and hard on, become this blurred mess.</p>

<p>The only other solution I&rsquo;ve found is to host the images on Flickr and then link them over. I get to post the image that I want in any resolution that I please. This solution does not make for very good Tumblr citizen but it makes for a better web site.</p>

<hr />
<p>The irony of course is that both Flickr and Tumblr are owned by Yahoo! - so the image is hosted on their servers anyway. The whole thing is just annoying and you end up loosing out on some of the cool features that are inherently a part of Tumblr - for the sake of a few measily pixels.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>You know what I miss? I miss <em>daily</em> blogging.</p>

<p>5 years ago, the last time I was blogging on any regular basis, there was a rhythm to my publishing madness. Every morning would bring with it the promise of writing something new; sometimes it would be trivial, other times it would be &lsquo;important&rsquo;. The trick was to <em>show up every day</em>.</p>

<p>The last year has honestly stripped me of very little personal time as I juggle being a husband, a father and an engineer. What little spare time I do have, I try and relax by drawing, inking, reading or watching a little bit of television as time permits.</p>

<p>In that respect my online worlds are effectively extensions of a <em>life diary</em> that I’m creating piece by piece. I might own the content, but it’s hosted by someone else.</p>

<hr />
<p>When I sit and consider what I’ve created over the last several years, my online endeavours are not high on that priority list. I&rsquo;ve created countless websites, written at this stage thousands of posts (large and small) and while it did provide me with an outlet, none of it will last very long. Maybe none of it will matter except as a marker from a different time in my life.</p>

<p>My online space has now become somewhat diluted across multiple platforms (an <a href="http://www.instagram.com/khaledaboualfa">Instagram</a>, several Tumblrs, a couple of Twitters, a <a href="http://www.dribbble.com/khaledaboualfa">Dribbble</a>, a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/khaledaboualfa">Flickr</a>, a <a href="http://tinyletter.com/moonracket">Tinyletter</a>). What happens is that I end up not generating as much content for each platform but what I&rsquo;ve realised is that this might not actually matter. What matters is work that I find <em>meaningful</em> that will last.</p>

<p>Which then leads to be to start questioning my general output. What work can I look back on objectively and be proud of? Over the last 4 &frac12; years my output has been limited to all things <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a>. This was a pretty concious decision on my part. Focus on a single project allows it to grow it&rsquo;s potential. This is the work that I have devoted my free time for, and this is the work that I hope will blossom over the coming year.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been drawing <a href="http://moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a> for several years now. You wouldn&rsquo;t know it, as I&rsquo;ve only released around 23 images in total. The truth is that I&rsquo;ve got hundreds of sketches, doodles and even strips that have not been released (apart from the odd snap on <a href="http://instagram.com/khaledaboualfa">Instagram</a>). There are two resons for this:</p>

<ol><li><strong>Quality</strong>. The creative process and the quality in the first few years really wasn&rsquo;t that great. When I look back at <em>Season One</em> I cringe (and that was the art I was &lsquo;happy&rsquo; with at the time). However if I didn&rsquo;t persevere, then I wouldn&rsquo;t be in the position I am now, where I am comfortable enough to draw the characters in a few short minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Schedule</strong>. This one is actually a self imposed reason. My thinking being that I cannot really predict how often I&rsquo;m likely to finish a drawing and do all the necessary post-production work. So instead the idea was to bank an entire season before I started publishing. The problem with this decision, is that nothing gets published (in my case over a year) and any momentum is lost.</li>
</ol>
<p>That is actually an issue that I would <em>like</em> to address. The simplest solution is to publish things as they become available and ignore the whole issue of <em>schedule</em>. As a companion to this solution I&rsquo;ve also decided to create small single image strip (created in my favourite notebooks of all time, the Midori MD A5 notebooks) that takes a few hours to draw and ink to provide stop gaps between more involved strips.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the first image.</p>
