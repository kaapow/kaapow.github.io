<ul>
  <li>Hoping Iceland pull an equaliser against Nigeria, along with Mexico they’re my two favourite <em>underdog</em> teams.</li>
  <li>How the hell did Nigeria just score twice in 20 minutes? Where Argentina had no way in?</li>
  <li>VAR comes to their rescue…and he hoofs the penalty. What is going on with the penalties this World Cup?</li>
  <li>Argentina can actually make it through to the next round now, after their abysmal performance yesterday to Croatia.</li>
  <li>Both goals by Musa are some of the best <em>individual</em> performance goals I’ve seen in the world cup. Didn’t think they had it in them to be honest.</li>
  <li>A great second half in this game, makes this group qualifying a fascinating one to watch.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a need, in my view, for someone as a standard against which our characters can measure themselves. Without a ruler to do it against you won’t make the crooked straight.<br />
— <em>Seneca</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such a great metaphor to capture one’s struggle to improve yourself, or <strong>straighten</strong> yourself.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/06/12/manhood-for-amateurs.html">Manhood for Amateurs</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>📚 I <em>finally</em> finished a book this year, Michael Chabon’s <em>Manhood for Amateurs</em>. The book was written back in 2009 (which I believe is now being followed up with a sequel of sorts) and was the right book to read, as the words have resonated with me, as a newly minted father of a second son.</p>

<p>I started it around the time my Ryan was born and it’s taken me 6 months to complete these 300 pages. I love to read, but <strong>clearly</strong> I don’t carve enough time to carry the action out. My reading has been pretty scattered across multiple books that I never seem to finish. I’m hoping this signals a return to a more regular reading pattern.</p>

<p>What I also realised was that I’m not happy with how I’m reading. Or more accurately, the lack of taking notes or capturing the most interesting parts of books I read.</p>

<hr />

<p>Here are some key quotes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Art is a form of exploration, of sailing off into the unknown alone, heading for those unmarked places on the map. If children are not permitted - not taught - to be adventurers and explorers as children, what will become of the world of adventure, of stories, of literature itself?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why else had they done it - built it all up so they could then knock it all down? After a marriage breaks, there is nothing more pointless than the child, to that child, of that marriage.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The song has to take you by surprise, catch you when your guard is down, when you aren’t expecting it - ideally, when you aren’t even listening to the radio at all. A bright little piece of your life passes you by in a car with the windows rolled down, wells up in the pain-relief aisle of a Rite-Aid. That kind of chance encouter can’t happen as readily on an iPod you’ve programmed yourslf.</p>
