      <div class="e-content"><p>When I released <em><a href="http://moonracket.com">Moon Racket!</a></em> I was never happy with the website, as I felt it wasn&rsquo;t a particularly good showcase of the work. While the general presentation of the same exact strips on both <a href="http://facebook.com/moonracket">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://tapastic.com/series/moonracket">Tapastic</a> was marginally better, I&rsquo;ve wanted to make sure that I addressed this issue before starting to release Season Two.</p>

<p>After many months of the final mockup gathering dust in the project folder, I was able to buckle down over the weekend and put the site together.</p>

<p><a href="http://moonracket.com"><img src="http://www.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/2916501b8d.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The main aim for this design was to make sure that the focus of the site was on the strips themselves. This explains the gradual grade from the top and bottom bars to white and focusing on the strip. Not everything is perfect (It&rsquo;s not a fully responsive site or at least not in a meaningful way), however improvements will be ongoing now that the base is established.</p>

<p>In addition to the new window dressing, you can finally read all the <em>Moon Racket!</em> strips in <strong>high definition</strong> - I re-uploaded high resolution versions of all the images to look good on a retina display.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>During the last 9 months leading up to Zane&rsquo;s arrival, Yasmine decided it was <s>good</s> necessary that we listen only to classical music when travelling in the car. As she is also against Bluetooth (and technology in general), we actually bought several CDs for the car.</p>

<p>The outcome of this antiquated method of listening to music basically meant that we were listening to the same CDs <em>on repeat</em>. Earlier this evening Zane was a little upset, so we put on the CD.</p>

<p>The first track is J.S.Bach&rsquo;s Concerto in D Minor for 2 Violins, BWV 1043. Within seconds of the first note being played, Zane&rsquo;s face honestly lit up and he smiled in a way we&rsquo;ve not seen since he was born. They really can hear everything in the womb.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>1 week ago today  that&rsquo;s Thursday 29th of May, I arrived home and Yasmine is faffing around telling me that we&rsquo;ve got to sort out <strong>my</strong> bag for the hospital and that she&rsquo;s got several errands that she wants to run over the weekend (cut her hair, pop into Mothercare for some last minute items). I nod my head, not registering everything after an excessively long week at work.</p>

<p>A few hours later, while sitting (and trying to decompress) on the couch, watching something completely irrelevant, Yasmine calls me from the bathroom. I drag myself to the bathroom to see what she wants.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Honey, I think my water has broken.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a moment of Hollywood weakness I tried to show that I wasn&rsquo;t worried.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We&rsquo;re about to have a baby!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I knew that labour was going to be tough but my god I was NOT expecting the drama that would unfold over the next 20 hours. Obviously I now have a much deeper appreciation pregnant women and what they have to go through. For the course of 9 months they endure <em>morning</em> sickness (stupid and incorrect name, it should be called <em>all day, at any time</em> sickness but maybe <em>morning</em> was more catchy?), pains, aches, heartburn, funny bowl movements, general discomfort when you&rsquo;re hauling around an extra 16kg of weight.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;d think that was enough right? Wrong. After they&rsquo;ve endured all of that, they&rsquo;re treated to MANY hours of torture. After that is done, then you get the discomforts associated with healing and a messy hormonal system. In my engineering mind I kept thinking, there must be a better more efficient way right (that didn&rsquo;t involve cutting a woman open for a c-section)?</p>

<p>The 20 hours of labour tested my resolve completely. Seeing your wife in excruciating pain for HOURS is hard when all you can do is wait, pace, loose some sleep and worry. The last 30 minutes before Zane was born was easily one of the most difficult times in our lives together or apart.</p>

<p><em>However&hellip;</em></p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t even begin to describe the elation one feels when you see your first born child. It&rsquo;s a feeling unlike one I&rsquo;ve ever and will probably ever feel again - for those that have experienced it you know what I&rsquo;m talking about, for those that are considering it I highly recommend it. I stayed at the top of the bed and when the doctor raised Zane he was blue and red and yet instantly my eyes just became completely overwhelmed with tears. Those tears didn&rsquo;t leave for several hours. In fact nearly a week later I still can feel the tears starting to come back to me as I write this.</p>

<p>So I sit here 1 week to the day and I marvel at our son and the long journey to bring him here. How did 1 week go by already?</p>

		<h1><a href="/2014/05/23/get-organised.html">Get Organised</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>It&rsquo;s the quiet before the imminent arrival of little Zane. We&rsquo;ve bought all the gear, gone to the antenatal classes and now the waiting game begins. So I&rsquo;ve decided (belatedly I&rsquo;ll admit) to take some time and get my digital house in order.</p>

<p>I decided to take a step back and reviewed what software solutions I have at my disposable and start putting the <em>correct</em> kind of information into each bucket.</p>

<h3>Dropbox</h3>

<p>Previously I had relied almost exclusively on <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> to provide me with all of my synced document needs. Dropbox is amazing for so many things but it&rsquo;s become clear that the folder structure keeps things hidden - to the point that I don&rsquo;t even remember I had certain files and it&rsquo;s definitely not the most secure of places for the more sensetive documents.</p>

<p><em>Active Projects</em> - I&rsquo;m using Dropbox as both a backup tool and a versioning tool as well (sure I should be using Github for that, but this works for me).</p>

<p><em>Sharing Documents</em> - I share a great deal of files at work with different people in different companies. Dropbox has been a lifesaver for this sort of task.</p>

<p><em>Backups</em> - Photos from my iPhone make their way into the photos folder in Dropbox. I&rsquo;ve created a backup folder that collects my social media output (Tumblr, Twitter, Facebook, Flickr) into one place. To do that I&rsquo;m using <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a>, which is a great little service for this sort of thing.</p>

<h3>1Password</h3>

<p>All sensetive information gets put into the vault. The feature that galvanised this solution for me is the ability to add multiple attachments to any account or item. As such all of my bank statements get added in there, fully encrypted and ready to be accessed on the go if necessary.</p>

<h3>Evernote</h3>

<p><a href="http://evernote.com">Evernote</a> is the latest addtion to my organisational workflow. I have to wonder why I didn&rsquo;t try this suite before. Actually <em>scrap that</em>, I did try this suite out years ago but I just couldn&rsquo;t get into the version at the time. The biggest advantage for me is the fact that multiple types of data can be combined into a single note. I can have a pdf, with a link, a note and a zip file all in a single note for easy review and access.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s going to take a while to get everything in here, but I have faith that once it&rsquo;s done, I&rsquo;ll be able to access things much faster.</p>

<h3>Simplenote</h3>

<p>This is my scratchpad. <a href="http://simplenote.com">Simplenote</a> is used for all those pieces of information that are not sensetive in anyway but that would be useful being accessed quickly.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>There was a time in my life where I remember that I resented change. It was something that I later came to understand was actually a major component of life. Major change can either come in regular doses, or can wait dormantly, in the shadows for years. </p>

<p>Change is <em>everywhere</em> at the moment. </p>

<p>We’re gearing up for our first baby’s imminent arrival, which has honestly completely consumed our every free moment. </p>

<p>At work, yesterday was Naresh and Max’s last day onsite. I sat next to Naresh for the last 2 years as we saw the building go from a hole in the ground to something much, much more. We’ve effectively been in the ‘trenches’ together (at least the engineering/construction trenches) and while we’ve not come out unscratched, I think we’ve both learnt an incredible amount, from each other.</p>

<p>Don’t fight change. Embrace it. Life will be easier that way.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2014/04/30/focus-and-freedom.html">Focus and Freedom</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>I missed this.</p>

<p>For 10 years I&rsquo;ve published to the internet through <a href="http://www.brokenkode.com">Broken Kode</a>. These last few years that site has meandered a great deal, but has now finally settled down to a very focused topic, which ironically is what is was always intended in the first place, namely a process site for my comic book and creative work.</p>

<p>Although I intend to rebrand it (and therefore discontinue the name that has held up for 10 years), I think the change will be a <em>positive one</em>.</p>

<p>This site (<a href="http://khaledaboualfa.co">khaledaboualfa.co</a>) is wearing it&rsquo;s heart on it&rsquo;s sleeve. There will likely be little focus, which is actually by design. My intention is to give myself the room and space to express myself and my thoughts freely and comment on any topic that happens to capture my imagination at the time. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll get some people to stay for the ride.</p>

<p>Like I said I missed <em>this</em>.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2014/04/17/process.html">Process</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>A few months after publishing the last episode of <em>Moon Racket</em> Season One, I&rsquo;ve now finished writing the second season. If the first season was all about seeing a project through to completion, the second season is taking the idea and adding some polish.</p>

<p>One of the things I&rsquo;ve always enjoy watching is the natural maturing process a body of work sometimes goes through while the creative minds behind the work hone their skills. Although I can only dream of reaching the lofty heights reached by a series like <em>The Simpsons</em>, an apt comparison in one regard would be how the first season looked compared to what we recognise as the characters now. There was a maturing process and this is something that I aim to achieve for Season Two, both for the writing and the art.</p>

<hr />
<p>I&rsquo;ve already spoken about the proposed increase in paper size (and therefore <a href="http://brokenkode.com/post/78836757301/panel-size">Panel Size</a>) of the coming season. One thing I realised very quickly was just how important the initial scripts were. The first season had a bit of looseness in the scripts. I would often times rewrite the thing as I was drawing it - sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>For this season I decided to really pour into the details of every script. I would not go on to the next one until I actually had completed the one I was working on. If I got stuck on any one strip, I would remove it from the document I was working on and paste it into a second document that acted as my &lsquo;graveyard&rsquo;. This allowed me to focus on one strip at a time. What I realised was that some ideas took days, weeks to mature or develop in my head and other ideas effectively wrote themselves. What I also realised was the last 5 episodes were extremely difficult to complete, which might have been a mental block on my side, or the fact that I had a lot going on in my life at the time.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2014/03/07/panel-sizes.html">Panel Sizes</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p><em>Moon Racket</em> started out life on my iPhone 4. It was a method for me to actually use my latest &lsquo;computer&rsquo; to create content, rather than just consume on it.</p>

<p>The obvious limitation was the size of the screen, so I decided to use this as the panel size (or at least the same aspect ratio 3:2) with the idea that eventually when I release the series digitally, it will already be formatted for this screen size.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/15527be017.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I realised pretty quickly that although I was getting the benefit of colour and I was using my iPhone, the creation process was stifling and the end result wasn&rsquo;t as consistent as I would have liked. I decided to take the strip back to the physical world and made the investment in an A4 hardcover art book with thick paper - no idea what the grade is, but it was reasonably smooth (not bristol board smooth). It was one of the best decisions I&rsquo;ve made. All of <em>Moon Racket</em> lives in this A4 book.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/417fa9555f.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Traditionally the newspaper industry and therefore the artform itself, comic strips are typically 4 panels, 4 inches by 3 inches. In an attempt to grow, Season Two will be framed with the typical 3:4 ratio panels. I&rsquo;ve had to get some American sized paper, 11x14 inches, which frustratingly is slightly larger than A4 but smaller than A3 - and means I can no longer use my A4 book.</p>

<p>Hopefully this change will mean that the art will breathe more and therefore should allow the strip to better shine.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2014/01/26/season-one-report.html">Season One Report Card</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>Today marks 20 consecutive weeks that I&rsquo;ve published a new episode for my online comic <a href="http://moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a>, so I thought it would be nice to take stock and review the experience.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/ae9a7dd334.jpg" alt="" /><strong>All 20 strips in a nice overview image.</strong></p>

<p>Rather than being completely harsh (which would come easily for me when reviewing my own work), I think I&rsquo;ll first highlight some of the things that I thought went well.</p>

<p>Firstly, the strip never missed a ship date. All 20 episodes were released every Sunday for 20 weeks. Secondly, the general reaction on both <a href="http://facebook.com/moonracket">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://moonracket.com">Tumblr</a> have been really great and I&rsquo;m grateful to everyone who has liked, shared or read the strip. I&rsquo;m still debating whether or not <a href="http://tapastic.com/series/moonracket">Tapastic</a> is worth it, but I do it for the 3 that have subscribed and hopefully enjoying the strip.</p>

<p>Overall, I give the strips an overall <strong>5/10</strong>. There are some stories that I think worked out better than others but the truth is I could have written better stories and could have developed the characters better.</p>

<p>One aspect that I am genuinely happy with is the <em>evolution</em> of the artwork. I still think it&rsquo;s ok and only the errors jump out at me, but at least I can see a proper improvement over the life of the strip.</p>

<p>With that in mind the series is going to take a break for a few months while I write better stories (currently I have 10 in the bag) and come back stronger with Season Two.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>In early 2012 I started work on my first iOS app with my cousin. The trip was long and meandering (one which unfortunately we never completed).</p>

<p>One of the things that I made sure I did was keep all my notes and scribbles in a single notebook. This was a bit of a departure for me, but one that I have maintained for all my future projects. Each project has it&rsquo;s own notebook where most things can be found.</p>

<p>One sketch that I attribute the inking of <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a> to, is the original icon sketch for the app.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/2bd6f881a3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The importance of this sketch was in making me appreciate the Muji 0.38mm black gel ink pen as a tool for clean inking and providing the correct thickness of line that I was originally looking for - but couldn&rsquo;t really achieve with my Copic pens.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/a6e0e965e6.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>While this pen isn&rsquo;t completely suitable for the clean lined artwork of <em>Chroma</em>, it still has it&rsquo;s uses for all the cross-hatching required. Sometimes you stumble on a tool that elevates your art, for me it was my Muji gel ink pen.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>When you reflect back on a year, the hope is always to find a number of moments that put a smile on your face - thankfully these last 12 months have given me with a lot to smile about.</p>

<p>Getting the news that I am going to become a father was the definite highlight - a fact which I’ve honestly not wrapped my head completely around, but I’ve started preparing<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Creatively this year is one of my strongest in recent memory. I drew an entire season of <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a>, a slew of additional promotional images and designed the website - although it’s going to get some redesign love in the new year. Surprisingly the comic work didn’t end there as I completely rewrote the script for <em>Chroma</em> (my upcoming comics project) that has been many years in the making.</p>

<p>I redesigned this here site for the umpteenth time, however I do believe that this iteration is by far my most mature attempt and probably one that I will likely not change fundamentally for many years to come. The aspects of the site that I am most happy with are the colours and the typography, which is the first time in many years that I am ahead of the curve in certain respects (small caps only valid in certain browsers, surprisingly not Safari/Webkit proper).</p>

<p>Finally I started work on two iOS apps. The first one, we’ve scrapped and shelved, the other I hope we get some traction in the new year and we finally ship something, because as we all know:</p>
