      <div class="e-content"><p>For years I&rsquo;ve been exceptionally content with my choice of pen, the Muji 0.38mm gel ink pen, in <strong>black</strong>. The main issue with the pen was the cheap plastic enclosure that held that wonderful refill. I grew exceptionally bored of it and I was willing to splurge some money on something that was better.</p>

<p>Previously I&rsquo;d splash money on stationary related to my artwork, but never for my work related stationary. My hunt for a better enclosure made me look at all of my stationary in a decidedly different way and led me down a rabbit hole that I am yet to emerge from (listened to all the episodes of the <a href="http://www.relay.fm/penaddict">Pen Addict podcast</a>). Thankfully the situation is a lot more under control than when I first started on this journey. After a year of buying a wide range of pens, I now know pretty much what will appeal to me and will fit into my rotation pretty much instantly.</p>

<p>I intend to go into a decent amount of detail but rather than writing everything in one single shot, I&rsquo;ll highlight the main takes for now:</p>

<ol><li>I&rsquo;m likely not going to be expanding my fountain pen collection past a <a href="http://www.pelikan.com/pulse/Pulsar/en_US_INTL.FWI.displayShop.106959./classic-205-black-silver">Pelikan M205</a> in the future. It stops here at my <a href="http://www.sailorpen.com/professional-gear.html">Sailor Pro Gear Slim</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.midori-japan.co.jp/md/en/products/notebook.html">Midori MDs</a> are the only choice of sketch notebooks that I will likely ever use. These are perfect. The A4 version is next on my list.</li>
<li>Nothing beats my <a href="http://www.muji.eu/pages/online.asp?Sec=13&amp;Sub=52">Muji 0.38mm pen</a> for quick sketching and inking - the <em>Pilot Juice</em> pens come in a close second. I&rsquo;ve still to find my ideal holder - the original Takumi pen was a massive disappointment, hopefully version 2 goes in a better direction. Might have to design one myself.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve enjoyed using my <a href="http://www.1101.com/store/techo/2016/planner/index.html">Hobonichi Techo</a> (although not as often as I would want to and not with the type of content I was hoping for) - will be trying out an A5 version this year., maybe that format suits me better?</li>
<li>I will be getting a Nanami <a href="http://www.nanamipaper.com/products/copy-of-seven-seas-standard-a5-blank-journal.html">Seven Seas Standard</a> notebook in the future as well.</li>
<li>The Penxo is one of the best conceived and delivered Kickstarters that I&rsquo;ve ever used - even though they fucked up my order and gave me the wrong leads.</li>
<li>I will be getting a <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/colors/">Field Notes</a> subscription in November. I like the fun of seeing what these guys come up with and have been enjoying collecting these notebooks.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve still not found my ideal EDC pen. I still have time to back the <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/buy/karas-kustoms-edk">EDK</a>, but not sure if that&rsquo;s the one for me.</li>

		<h1><a href="/2015/08/22/gallery-its-been.html">Hobonichi Techo 2016</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>It’s been a year already? The latest lineup for the Hobonichi Techo 2016 (in Japanese for now) is <a href="http://www.1101.com/store/techo/">online</a>. Unlike last year, where I was completely taken by the buzz and the excitement of something new, I now know what to expect and more crucially what I like and need.</p>

<p>The A6 size hasn’t worked out for me as I would have liked. I found myself running out of space on occasions, or ended up looking to complete my thoughts elsewhere. That’s going to have to change if I’m going to use this book as my catchall for everything. I am a huge lover of the A5 size, and while the ‘Cousin’ version of the Hobonichi planner is in fact all in Japanese, it’s functional enough to not be a problem.</p>

<p>The biggest draw for this notebook is the paper, which is without equal. I’ve tried many different papers this year, but the Tomoe River paper has stood out as the undeputed champion when it comes to making the most out of inks and pens that I use.</p>

<p>The Hobonichi Techo will remain my notebook of choice, where I dump all my thoughts and ideas into a single place. The only bad thing is that I now need a new cover - the new ones are a big disappointment, so I’m looking to Etsy for some alternatives. Top of my list are these covers from <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/241142080/a5-burgundy-leather-notebook-journal?ref=shop_home_feat_4">StrideRidge</a> - and they’re actually affordable unlike some of these ‘official’ covers on offer.</p>

I’ll be getting into my overall setup at some point, but this is a decided shift from me as I have until now published only in black and white.</p>

<p>This is not a sign that <strong>I</strong> no longer believe in black &amp; white, but maybe rather the strip is better served on the internet with a splash of colour - I’ll report on whether that theory holds water after a few of these have gone out, but my feeling is that this small change will make a noticable difference.</p>

<p>As this is still the first one, like with most strips, there will be an evolution of the colour art as I get more comfortable with the process and try different ideas.The only downside, is that the <em>Moon Racket!</em> website will now have to be tweaked slightly to capture this colour palette (which is slightly different from previous iterations of colour that I’ve used in promo art).</p>

One of the things I’m currently working on is the coloured version of the characters.</p>

<p>One of the comments that’s been made to me is that the black and white version of the strip is holding back potential readers. Some just are not all that into <strong>glorious</strong> black &amp; white comic art - it feels, <em>unfinished</em>. This week’s strip will be an experiment to see whether or not that really is the case.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2015/07/01/bullet-points.html">6 Bullet Points</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been following the Greek situation with keen interest - being the country in which I grew up in, where my parents currently live and where my brother just this morning went to an interview for his citizenship.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been pretty interesting to see Yanis Varoufakis in action and read the words he&rsquo;s been posting over the last 6 months. He&rsquo;s chosen arguably the <em>worst</em> job in Greece at the moment but this latest 6 short bullet points is an interesting stake in the ground. His latest post <a href="http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2015/07/01/why-we-recommend-a-no-in-the-referendum-in-6-short-bullet-points/">Why we recommend a NO in the referendum – in 6 short bullet points</a> is an interesting idea to summarise their government&rsquo;s thoughts on the subject.</p>

<p>While everyone is saying that a NO vote would effectively mean that Europe ejects Greece out of the Eurozone, Varoufakis is claiming that this would not happen. Why it will not happen is still not clear to me however. From an interview (with a less the eloquent minister in Syriza) on the BBC earlier today, it appears that they think that European law excludes such a thing from happening. Honestly when the money and stakes are this high, I doubt new rules cannot be rewritten.</p>

<p>Sunday is only a few short days away and we&rsquo;ll see how the Greek people will vote.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2015/06/23/four-dials.html">Four Dials</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>Recently I&rsquo;ve started listening to the podcast <a href="http://hellointernet.fm">Hello Internet </a> - if you&rsquo;ve not had a chance i recommend you listen and actually try and stick through it as its a pretty good conversation between two interesting hosts.</p>

<p>Just finished episode 3 (although I&rsquo;ve also listened to a few of the later episodes, and then jumped back) but the concept of 4 dials or light bulbs in ones life was discussed. The concept stuck with me however what I realised is that actually my dials are different due to my physical location. So to recap the original four dials:</p>

<ul><li>Family</li>
<li>Work</li>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Friends</li>
</ul>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve realised is that while the first 3 items remain relevant in my life, the last one however has dropped effectively to 0%. In its place my <em>comic book</em> work has taken its place.</p>

<p>When we moved over to Doha the idea of starting fresh with no support network to start from was a daunting one. The truth is, we&rsquo;ve not actually really developed this support network in any way since we moved here 3 years ago. Apart from the guys in the office, I&rsquo;ve really not ventured very far in this realm. I try and maintain my connections with my friends, but seeing as they are far away, this was one aspect that I knew was going to take a hit. The concious decision was that we didn&rsquo;t expand that circle at all.</p>

<h3>By the Numbers</h3>

<p>This is effectively what my percentages look like at the moment:</p>

<ul><li>Family: 30%</li>
<li>Work: 50%</li>
<li>Health: 5%</li>
<li>Comics: 10%</li>
<li>Downtime: 5%</li>
</ul>
<p>Will I ever become a professional cartoonist? Not when I only am dedicating 10% of my energy to the task, it&rsquo;s really at best, a hobby, a simple side project. My job as an engineer isn&rsquo;t going away any time soon and my family time and health time are as low as I&rsquo;m going to go at the moment.</p>

<p>The only part that I could take away is the downtime (watching movies, television, surfing the internet, reading a book or magazine). Those things however are important to keep you sane.</p>

<p>The problem I have with this breakdown is that the reality of the situation is such that I am actually using that 10% and doing wonders with it. I&rsquo;ve been able to create multiple websites that I run quasi-regularly. I&rsquo;ve been able to create a web comic that I&rsquo;ve invested an incredible amount of time to write, draw and now publish. I do acknowledge however that this has been at the expense of other things, and that&rsquo;s fine for the moment, but it&rsquo;s not going to stay like that for very long.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2015/06/22/moon-racket-on.html">Moon Racket! on Medium</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>I’ve decided to use <a href="http://www.medium.com/@moonracket">Medium</a> as an additional platform from which I publish the new season of my comic, <em>Moon Racket!</em> Multiple factors coalesced to make this decision.</p>

<p>In the past I have used 3 different platforms to publish and distribute my comic strip:</p>

<ol><li>The official <a href="http://moonracket.com">website</a>, hosted on Tumblr</li>
<li>The <a href="http://tinyletter.com/moonracket">newsletter</a>, powered by Tinyletter</li>
<li>Tapastic (at least in the first season).</li>
</ol>
<p>Moving forward I’ll be publishing on Medium, <em>Moon Racket!</em> and through the newsletter. So what brought about this change? To answer that question, I think I should answer another question, how have the other platforms been faring?</p>

<p>The truth is that each of the above platforms provided very specific (detrimental) restrictions on the artwork itself, but also allowed for a potentially wider distribution. The problem is that this wider distribution never manifested itself in a meaningful way.</p>

<h3>Tumblr</h3>

<p>Moon Racket! is hosted on Tumblr, a platform usually suited for rectangular posts that fit within the stream that is present for eveyone. The restrictions on images are therefore made to suit their platform. The maximum size of image that can be posted is one that is 1200px wide. On a retina screen that’s the equivalent of a 600px image. The effect of this restriction is that my comic always appears blurry.</p>

<p>While this is a nitpick, for a perfectionist like myself, it’s a deal breaker.</p>

<h3>Newsletter</h3>

<p>If I thought that Tumblr provided restrictions, then I was in for a rude awakening with my newsletter experience. This one can only be typically shown in a 600px wide image, otherwise it will break most inboxes.</p>

<p>My experience with Tinyletter has been mixed. But ultimately my question for a beautiful experience was wrecked by that platform’s constraints. In mitigate I’ve moved things over to Mailchimp, which I’m hoping will offer better options and experience.</p>

<p>Even then, I’m still not showcasing the art in the best possible way.</p>

<h3>Tapastic</h3>

<p>This platform holds promise, but once again there are size restrictions to the images that can be uploaded. While the platform as a whole does allow for a plethora of things aimed at comic content creators, I don’t believe that I would be able to reap many (any?) of those benefits.</p>

<p>It’s also being lost in the sea that is being published there. Some of which is aimed at a very different audience.</p>

<hr />
<p>Which brings me to Medium.</p>

<p>The editor provided on Medium is without question the best editor on the internet, have tried a very large number of them.</p>

<p>The other instant win for Medium is how the platform chooses to deal with images. They’re not just first class citizens, they are allowed to exist in a manner that makes them shine. In fact the more I write about this, the more convinced I am of what an idiot I am for not considering this platform earlier.</p>

<p>The biggest question I have is whether I can connect with an audience for an all ages comic strip about a robot (Corgan) and his worm friend (Alfie) that live on the moon, that’s made of cheese on Medium.</p>

<p>That’s a journey I’m happy to take, because if nothing else I’ll take it in <strong>style</strong>.</p>

<p>I got a bunch of Shinhan Art pens last week. I was so excited to use them that this little image popped out in a matter of minutes. One of the most encouraging things about sticking with a bunch of characters is watching their evolution happen before your eyes. There is a confidence that I’m aware of and actually <em>really</em> enjoying experiencing at the moment. I just wish I could do this more regularly.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2015/06/09/gallery-moon-racket.html">Moon Racket Website Update</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>Ever since I ‘relaunched’ the <em>Moon Racket!</em> <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">website</a> I’ve not been particularly happy with the footer. I always knew that it would have to change. My initial use of the footer was to effectively send people to different parts of the net that related to all things <em>Moon Racket!</em> - the <a href="http://www.twitter.com/moonracket">Twitter</a> account, the facebook account, the <a href="http://www.tinyletter.com/moonracket">newsletter</a> and this <a href="http://www.procssr.tumblr.com">process blog</a>. All of these links have now moved to the very top of the website, in a nice menu bar, that’s out of the way, but fully accessible if needed.</p>

<p>I received some negative feedback, when I publishing the first season, that sticks in my mind. It was from a woman that didn’t really understand what was going on in the series. On reflection I totally get that. At the time I couldn’t do anything about it, as the stories and art had been created. I knew I had to do better with the second series.</p>

<p>In an attempt to make the series more accessible, the stories have been written to not be as presumtive, but also the website should be first time reader friendly. To address these two issues, I’ve decided to use the footer as a <strong>What You Need to Know</strong> section, complete with character head shots and names, using those sketches from the <a href="http://procssr.tumblr.com/post/120693390813/from-the-desk-1-first-in-the-series-a-set-of">previous post</a>.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p><em>Routine</em> is everything when you&rsquo;re trying to develop and build something. To aid the routine from happening and not being taken off the rails, <em>constraints</em> are typically added into the mix.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago I decided to publish something new every weekday on this here process site. While I definitely don&rsquo;t want to go <em>meta</em> (and blog about blogging), I thought it was important to note that I&rsquo;ve come up with a way to help guide me through this publishing schedule. Each week I&rsquo;ll aim to publish a post in one of these categories:</p>

<ol><li>Marketing</li>
<li>Design</li>
<li>Character Development</li>
<li>From my Desk</li>
<li>Tools of the Trade</li>
</ol>
<p>The reason for publishing is that it focuses my mind to <strong>always be creating</strong>. It&rsquo;s also a great way to help me work things out. Publishing something online is somehow more concrete that writing a bunch of words either in notebooks or in random text files that live in my Dropbox folder.</p>

<p>Not sure how the idea came about, but this is effectively Alfie’s first appearance.</p>

<p>I needed a colour that would <em>pop</em> against the grey backgrounds that I was using. I also remember that after I drew him I realised that the little guy was an organic being and so would need an air bubble to breathe through while on the moon…please don’t argue with my logic, it’s <strong>fragile</strong>.</p>

<p>This is also the only time that Alfie would be drawn this small. All subsequent drawings have him coming to Corgan’s shoulder.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>One of the things that has been completely invaluable to us this first year of Zane’s life has been the show <em>Baby Einstein</em>. Living away from any family that can help us with the boy has been a challenge at times, but these 22 programmes have acted like a baby sitter of sorts to keep him occupied briefly while we do things like eating our dinner, cleaning up the kitchen or putting a laundry - you know the super exciting things in life.</p>

<p>Zane <em>loves</em> these characters. Something about them strike a real cord with him. So when his first birthday came about, I knew we had to celebrate with them. I’m planning on getting the art behind these characters made as a print soon to hang up in his room.</p>

<p>What’s amazing to me is just how great the cake came out, it’s a technology I’ve seen used before (as I was reminded by my wife), but I’ve never done anything with it. Here’s to many more happy birthday’s Zane. What a year it’s beeen.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>Logo for a mystery project I’ve been working on for several months now. It’s early days still, but wanted to share the <em>process</em> I go through for creating a logo. Started off in a <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com">Fieldnote</a> (<a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/colors/tworivers/">Two Rivers edition</a> if you have to ask), then moved it over to a Muji A5 notebook and then into <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a>.</p>

<p>Partially inspired by <a href="https://vimeo.com/113751583">this video</a> of Mr.Draplin - although our A’s go in different directions.</p>

<p>As a comparison to my <a href="http://procssr.tumblr.com/post/119905795087/moon-racket-character-study-corgan-continuing">previous post</a> and to showcase the character’s progression I quickly whipped up a sketch of Corgan in his current guise (in full colour).</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p><em>What kind of audience do I think <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket!</a> is intended for and how do I reach them?</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been struggling with this question a lot recently, in the lead up to releasing the second season. This then brought up a series of <em>other</em> questions.</p>

<ol><li>What are the topics the series tackles?</li>
<li>Where can I find an audience and declare to them the genius that is <em>Moon Racket!</em>, while not appearing like a <strong>complete</strong> douche bag pimping my shit like a second rate car salesman?</li>
<li>Can I focus on a niche group of people with a specific interest, that would appreciate <em>Moon Racket!</em> and what it has to offer?</li>
<li>Is this series even worth promoting?</li>
</ol>
<p>My intention has always been to create a great strip, that I would like to see myself and I never honestly even considered these questions  when I created the strip. I <em>foolishly</em> expected that between Facebook and Twitter there would be an <em>easy</em> way of marketing my wares. The reality of course is far different and that achieving any traction via social media is reasonably limited (at least for my little webcomic).</p>

<p>In order to try and find different answers and solutions to this question, I&rsquo;ll be tackling this topic in more detail over the coming weeks, reporting on how certain avenues have actually helped the cause.</p>

<p>Continuing this series of posts on the evolution of characters from <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket!</a>, this is first full sketch of Corgan.</p>

<p>What’s facinating to me is just how much information was captured in this one image that I don’t even remember creating. The main features of the character are there, such as the white boots, the shape of the head and the eyes and most importantly the colour palette that was chosen.</p>

<p>The neck reduced in height significantly in later iterations, but this has always been a general favourite sketch of mine because it helped define the world I am trying to create in many subtle ways.</p>

<p>The image that started <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a>.</p>

<p>The incredible part (when you consider the physical and hardware constraints) is that it was all created on an iPhone 4. I’ve written about this before (probably on my now defunct Facebook page), the intention was to create a super <em>simple</em> character that could be easily drawn on that tiny little screen.</p>

<p>As time went on, the character evolved. While I now find him incredibly easy to draw (and can tell instantly when I’ve not done a good job of my lines), that wasn’t always the case.</p>

<p>In fact the first year of Corgan’s life, I wasn’t super comfortable with certain aspects of his drawing him (so much so I remember the very first strip, I thought to trace him as I spent long on the first panel, but quickly realised that I was being stupid and foolish).</p>
