      <div class="e-content"><p><em>Routine</em> is everything when you&rsquo;re trying to develop and build something. To aid the routine from happening and not being taken off the rails, <em>constraints</em> are typically added into the mix.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago I decided to publish something new every weekday on this here process site. While I definitely don&rsquo;t want to go <em>meta</em> (and blog about blogging), I thought it was important to note that I&rsquo;ve come up with a way to help guide me through this publishing schedule. Each week I&rsquo;ll aim to publish a post in one of these categories:</p>

<ol><li>Marketing</li>
<li>Design</li>
<li>Character Development</li>
<li>From my Desk</li>
<li>Tools of the Trade</li>
</ol>
<p>The reason for publishing is that it focuses my mind to <strong>always be creating</strong>. It&rsquo;s also a great way to help me work things out. Publishing something online is somehow more concrete that writing a bunch of words either in notebooks or in random text files that live in my Dropbox folder.</p>

<p>Not sure how the idea came about, but this is effectively Alfie’s first appearance.</p>

<p>I needed a colour that would <em>pop</em> against the grey backgrounds that I was using. I also remember that after I drew him I realised that the little guy was an organic being and so would need an air bubble to breathe through while on the moon…please don’t argue with my logic, it’s <strong>fragile</strong>.</p>

<p>This is also the only time that Alfie would be drawn this small. All subsequent drawings have him coming to Corgan’s shoulder.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>One of the things that has been completely invaluable to us this first year of Zane’s life has been the show <em>Baby Einstein</em>. Living away from any family that can help us with the boy has been a challenge at times, but these 22 programmes have acted like a baby sitter of sorts to keep him occupied briefly while we do things like eating our dinner, cleaning up the kitchen or putting a laundry - you know the super exciting things in life.</p>

<p>Zane <em>loves</em> these characters. Something about them strike a real cord with him. So when his first birthday came about, I knew we had to celebrate with them. I’m planning on getting the art behind these characters made as a print soon to hang up in his room.</p>

<p>What’s amazing to me is just how great the cake came out, it’s a technology I’ve seen used before (as I was reminded by my wife), but I’ve never done anything with it. Here’s to many more happy birthday’s Zane. What a year it’s beeen.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p><em>What kind of audience do I think <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket!</a> is intended for and how do I reach them?</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been struggling with this question a lot recently, in the lead up to releasing the second season. This then brought up a series of <em>other</em> questions.</p>

<ol><li>What are the topics the series tackles?</li>
<li>Where can I find an audience and declare to them the genius that is <em>Moon Racket!</em>, while not appearing like a <strong>complete</strong> douche bag pimping my shit like a second rate car salesman?</li>
<li>Can I focus on a niche group of people with a specific interest, that would appreciate <em>Moon Racket!</em> and what it has to offer?</li>
<li>Is this series even worth promoting?</li>
</ol>
<p>My intention has always been to create a great strip, that I would like to see myself and I never honestly even considered these questions  when I created the strip. I <em>foolishly</em> expected that between Facebook and Twitter there would be an <em>easy</em> way of marketing my wares. The reality of course is far different and that achieving any traction via social media is reasonably limited (at least for my little webcomic).</p>

<p>In order to try and find different answers and solutions to this question, I&rsquo;ll be tackling this topic in more detail over the coming weeks, reporting on how certain avenues have actually helped the cause.</p>

<p>Continuing this series of posts on the evolution of characters from <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket!</a>, this is first full sketch of Corgan.</p>

<p>What’s facinating to me is just how much information was captured in this one image that I don’t even remember creating. The main features of the character are there, such as the white boots, the shape of the head and the eyes and most importantly the colour palette that was chosen.</p>

<p>The neck reduced in height significantly in later iterations, but this has always been a general favourite sketch of mine because it helped define the world I am trying to create in many subtle ways.</p>

<p>The image that started <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a>.</p>

<p>The incredible part (when you consider the physical and hardware constraints) is that it was all created on an iPhone 4. I’ve written about this before (probably on my now defunct Facebook page), the intention was to create a super <em>simple</em> character that could be easily drawn on that tiny little screen.</p>

<p>As time went on, the character evolved. While I now find him incredibly easy to draw (and can tell instantly when I’ve not done a good job of my lines), that wasn’t always the case.</p>

<p>In fact the first year of Corgan’s life, I wasn’t super comfortable with certain aspects of his drawing him (so much so I remember the very first strip, I thought to trace him as I spent long on the first panel, but quickly realised that I was being stupid and foolish).</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>Traditionally I’ve been a <strong>huge</strong> tinkerer of my websites. Thankfully I turned a leaf last year and decided on a structure and function for each site and only allowed time for enhancing or correcting initial laziness.</p>

<p>For my personal musing site, I recently updated the CSS code to benefit from some of the theme editing functions that Tumblr provides. The whole design of <a href="http://www.aboualfa.tumblr.com">KAA</a> was intentionally completely text based to allow me to have infinite colour combinations.</p>

<p>As a fun experiment, I’ve been taking screenshots of the various colour schemes that I come up with.</p>

<p>Of course, the fact that I’ve not actually written anything meaningful on there for 5 months begs the question of why the design is even relevant, I’m just glad it’s there for when I <strong>eventually</strong> pull my finger out.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>As this is a process site after all, I’ll be posting many more of these collections as I start to publish the new season.</p>

<p>This is one of the first images I ever drew using blue pencil lead instead of standard graphite. It’s also one of the first images that shows all the recent iterations of the characters are located in one image.</p>

<p>This image however was done pretty quickly (over an evening in fact, pencil to ink) and was meant to be a way of flexing my muscles. I didn’t even know what the characters were saying to each other (or why). You can read the final strip <a href="http://moonracket.com/post/117317667409/season-two-teaser">here</a>.</p>

<p>My biggest error (and I don’t know how it got through) was Woz’s stamp, where the perspective is all wrong. Sometime you just need a simple idea, which lets your pencil move - what you sacrifice for this freedom of movement is that the end result might not be as polished as you would hope.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2015/05/20/good-citizens.html">Good Citizens</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>There is much to like about Tumblr and publishing on Tumblr. There are however some constraints that I have been trying to work my way through. <em>High resolution</em> images on Tumblr are constrained in size to 1280px for normal high res photos and 2560x500px for panorama photos.</p>

<p>The problem is that Moon Racket strips don&rsquo;t really fall into either category. I could potentially use the panorama photos setting, but that would mean making things fit into a 500px height (which isn&rsquo;t great). Here&rsquo;s a look of what the panorma would look like using the <a href="http://moonracket.com/post/119418092109/in-plain-sight">latest weekly</a> (which dropped yesterday):</p>

<p><img src="http://www.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/a59360f369.jpg" alt="Panorama" /></p>

<p>Alternatively I could upload the image as 1280px. On a retina display that works out to be a 640px image (which honestly is tiny). My website allows for a 960px width - on a retina display that&rsquo;s 1920px. If I do let Tumblr do it&rsquo;s thing, then my crisp black lines that I&rsquo;ve worked long and hard on, become this blurred mess.</p>

<p>The only other solution I&rsquo;ve found is to host the images on Flickr and then link them over. I get to post the image that I want in any resolution that I please. This solution does not make for very good Tumblr citizen but it makes for a better web site.</p>

<hr />
<p>The irony of course is that both Flickr and Tumblr are owned by Yahoo! - so the image is hosted on their servers anyway. The whole thing is just annoying and you end up loosing out on some of the cool features that are inherently a part of Tumblr - for the sake of a few measily pixels.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>You know what I miss? I miss <em>daily</em> blogging.</p>

<p>5 years ago, the last time I was blogging on any regular basis, there was a rhythm to my publishing madness. Every morning would bring with it the promise of writing something new; sometimes it would be trivial, other times it would be &lsquo;important&rsquo;. The trick was to <em>show up every day</em>.</p>

<p>The last year has honestly stripped me of very little personal time as I juggle being a husband, a father and an engineer. What little spare time I do have, I try and relax by drawing, inking, reading or watching a little bit of television as time permits.</p>

<p>In that respect my online worlds are effectively extensions of a <em>life diary</em> that I’m creating piece by piece. I might own the content, but it’s hosted by someone else.</p>

<hr />
<p>When I sit and consider what I’ve created over the last several years, my online endeavours are not high on that priority list. I&rsquo;ve created countless websites, written at this stage thousands of posts (large and small) and while it did provide me with an outlet, none of it will last very long. Maybe none of it will matter except as a marker from a different time in my life.</p>

<p>My online space has now become somewhat diluted across multiple platforms (an <a href="http://www.instagram.com/khaledaboualfa">Instagram</a>, several Tumblrs, a couple of Twitters, a <a href="http://www.dribbble.com/khaledaboualfa">Dribbble</a>, a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/khaledaboualfa">Flickr</a>, a <a href="http://tinyletter.com/moonracket">Tinyletter</a>). What happens is that I end up not generating as much content for each platform but what I&rsquo;ve realised is that this might not actually matter. What matters is work that I find <em>meaningful</em> that will last.</p>

<p>Which then leads to be to start questioning my general output. What work can I look back on objectively and be proud of? Over the last 4 &frac12; years my output has been limited to all things <a href="http://www.moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a>. This was a pretty concious decision on my part. Focus on a single project allows it to grow it&rsquo;s potential. This is the work that I have devoted my free time for, and this is the work that I hope will blossom over the coming year.</p>

You wouldn&rsquo;t know it, as I&rsquo;ve only released around 23 images in total. The truth is that I&rsquo;ve got hundreds of sketches, doodles and even strips that have not been released (apart from the odd snap on <a href="http://instagram.com/khaledaboualfa">Instagram</a>). There are two resons for this:</p>

<ol><li><strong>Quality</strong>. The creative process and the quality in the first few years really wasn&rsquo;t that great. When I look back at <em>Season One</em> I cringe (and that was the art I was &lsquo;happy&rsquo; with at the time). However if I didn&rsquo;t persevere, then I wouldn&rsquo;t be in the position I am now, where I am comfortable enough to draw the characters in a few short minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Schedule</strong>. This one is actually a self imposed reason. My thinking being that I cannot really predict how often I&rsquo;m likely to finish a drawing and do all the necessary post-production work. So instead the idea was to bank an entire season before I started publishing. The problem with this decision, is that nothing gets published (in my case over a year) and any momentum is lost.</li>
</ol>
<p>That is actually an issue that I would <em>like</em> to address. The simplest solution is to publish things as they become available and ignore the whole issue of <em>schedule</em>. As a companion to this solution I&rsquo;ve also decided to create small single image strip (created in my favourite notebooks of all time, the Midori MD A5 notebooks) that takes a few hours to draw and ink to provide stop gaps between more involved strips.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the first image.</p>

This is a work in progress shot of a print I’m making for my boy Zane. The only thing that will calm him down is <em>Baby Einstein</em>, so this felt like the right kind of thing to put up on his wall.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>How often do you read a comment to a review on Amazon and can&rsquo;t stop laugh? This comment for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HYOGTTG">Zojirushi SM-SA48-BA Stainless Steel Mug</a> is one of those.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I bought the 20-ounce Zojirushi SM-SA60-BA the week after I got married so that I could keep my coffee warm on the commute to and from my new job downtown. It is literally the world&rsquo;s best travel mug. I could put steaming hot coffee in it in the morning, and if I forgot it in my truck I would still have steaming hot coffee for the drive home. No kidding! It&rsquo;s incredible. This was an exciting time for me. My time with Jennifer was limited but boundless in its glory. When I wasn&rsquo;t working, Jennifer and I would go hiking at the park, take road trips, sit up late and watch the stars. And, of course, have long nights of passionate love making. And through it all, my 20-ounce Zojirushi SM-SA60-BA provided me with hot, fresh coffee and a sleek, ergonomic feel. It&rsquo;s amazingly well designed and made to last.That was seven years ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He then follows it up with this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These days, Jennifer is as cold and emotionally distant as an uncharted asteroid. Now the most passionate conversations we have involve either our fiberoptic internet bandwidth or Your Damn Mother. At work, I am merely a shadow defined by once-authentic ambition. Original thought at my office is as pointless as a Libertarian vote, and my commute is like a scene from Walking Dead. I&rsquo;m writing this on my iPhone as I sit behind a third-world chicken truck on I-35. I&rsquo;m numbing myself to waste another eight hours at The Bad Place and fantasizing about replacing the painful vacuum of affection from She Who Cannot Read Oil Change Reminder Stickers with that new girl from logistics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And ends strongly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But now that I think about it, the one constant source of warmth and comfort in my life is still the 20-ounce Zojirushi SM-SA60-BA. Buy one. Buy one now, or feel only the chill yearning for an early grave that poor life decisions and emotional complacency can reap.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also bonus, read the followup <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R37USG0ZWZUEQM/ref=cm_cr_dp_cmt?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00HYOGUM2&amp;nodeID=284507&amp;store=kitchen#wasThisHelpful">comments</a> which give the actual truth, which is a lot more heartwarming.</p>
