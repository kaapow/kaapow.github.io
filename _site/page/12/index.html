      <div class="e-content"><p>Now that I’ve kicked the micro.blog tires for a few days, I can safely say a couple of things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I like the fact that this is a paid service. It means you have to get it and want to be involved in it to keep paying. The internet would be a different place if it didn’t make everything free.</li>
  <li>Loading the timeline is slow (on the site and certainly on iOS and the Mac). It perfectly usable but it doesn’t go unnoticed either. Not sure if this is something that <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> you have your eye on to improve in the future?</li>
  <li>Information isn’t located discusing the map for the development of the site (and therefore the core service). I understand that if something is good it will grow organically, but I would hope that there is a vision of where this connection is headed towards?</li>
  <li>Love being able to use Markdown in my posts.</li>
  <li>Shame no #hashtags. Not sure what the reasons for excluding it from the design were?</li>
  <li>Because it’s small everyone is talking to everyone else. The experience is only enhanced for the better because of it all.</li>
  <li>Love how it doesn’t matter how much or little you want to write, everything is welcome, it’s just displayed a little differently.</li>
  <li>I’d like to be able to edit my text from the site itself (as long as I’m logged in).</li>
  <li>I’d like to be able to download all my posts as single .md files, rather than a WordPress (???) export of some description. If not single .md files, then at least 1 single .md file. I’m currently using IFTTT to append my words to a text file via the RSS feed. The only problem my glorious Markdown is converted in the HTML.</li>

      <div class="e-content"><p>It’s been a super interesting week for my internet life. After pulling away from it all for a significant amount of time, I now believe I’ve found the necessary tools to get something out of it. This micro.blog is my therapy of sorts (some of the more deeply personal stuff is bound to stay hidden somewhere in my journal), and <a href="http://rmo.life">RMO</a> is pretty much my ideal setup for writing and editing long form (mainly due to the control the app affords me over the layout).</p>

<p>So for now my internet output is really split across 3 main locations, each with very specific goals:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://kaa.micro.blog">kaa.micro.blog</a> - Digital Drawer</li>
  <li><a href="http://rmo.life">rmo.life</a> - Capturing all things related to RMO</li>
  <li><a href="https://pinboard.in/u:kaa">pinboard.in/u:kaa</a> - Links you should remember</li>
</ol>

<p>Everything else can either be syndicated or deleted when the time is right.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>As I start to rekindle my love for writing and publishing online again (I’m still trying to decide on another word to <em>blogging</em>, a term I dislike the sound of), I’ve decided that I actually don’t want to clutter up my feed with a linklog - even if this link log has some exceptionally witty commentary. I’d like to keep this particular site dedicated to my more <em>thoughtful</em> digital explorations.</p>

<p>What I hadn’t considered was the power of the system that I actually have in place already in my <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:kaa/public/">Pinboard</a> account. Interesting links already exist there. The only part of this system I’ve not really been using is the description or notes section. You can subscribe to the RSS feed <a href="http://feeds.pinboard.in/rss/u:kaa/">here</a>.</p>

<p>What is really annoying to me is that I’ve had this Pinboard account for 6 years and never thought to invest the time in it before now.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2018/02/07/supply-shaving.html">Supply Shaving</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>I finally got my Kickstarter backed ‘Single Edge’ razor handle from <a href="https://getsupply.com">Supply</a> today. This is actually the second time that the package was sent to me, as the first set was lost in the mail. This usually doesn’t happen to me, but thankfully the guys over at <em>Supply</em> were gracious enough to hook me up with a full replacement.</p>

<p>The packaging did completely take me aback. It’s unashamedly aping Apple’s packaging. I know one is offering high tech gear, while there other is a razor handle, but I do wonder if the “homage” was taken a little too far in this instance. From this <a href="https://vimeo.com/167887992">videos</a>, an alternative packaging seems to have been made (possibly for the previous version?), which I actually prefer as it calls back to a time when these <em>injector blades</em> were widely used. I think the ‘heritage’ should be celebrated more.</p>

<p>The first thing you’ll notice about the handle itself is the sleekness of it followed by the sheer weightiness of it - this thing is <strong>heavy</strong>. The other thing that you’ll notice is the lovely little manual on the inside that goes through a bunch of interesting aspects that you should consider. Patrick and Jennifer are effectively trying to re-educate us on a style of shaving that went out of fashion, only to be replaced by electric razors and 5 blade disposable garbage from the supermarket.</p>

<p>Having shaved with it, I can say it does give you a very close shave. I’ve been using double edged safety razors for nearly 5 years now and while those shaves were infinitely better to what I was using before, this makes my skin much smoother. The draw back however is that in order for it to do this, it might irritate the skin - maybe only until my skin gets used to it?</p>

<p>To complete my pledge, I also opted for the <a href="https://getsupply.com/collections/all-products/products/marble-shaving-bowl">marble bowl</a>. It has ridges at the bottom. My shaving cream of choice is <a href="https://www.tayloroldbondst.co.uk">Taylor of Old Bond Street</a>, Sandlewood, which was first introduced to me by my brother in one of our care packages - I’ve been hooked ever since. The combination of the two created an amazingly smooth and thick rich lather.</p>

<p>It’s not every day that one enhances their daily routine of shaving. If you’re going to do it, go all in.</p>
