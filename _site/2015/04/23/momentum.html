  <div class="e-content">
  <p>I&rsquo;ve been drawing <a href="http://moonracket.com">Moon Racket</a> for several years now. You wouldn&rsquo;t know it, as I&rsquo;ve only released around 23 images in total. The truth is that I&rsquo;ve got hundreds of sketches, doodles and even strips that have not been released (apart from the odd snap on <a href="http://instagram.com/khaledaboualfa">Instagram</a>). There are two resons for this:</p>

<ol><li><strong>Quality</strong>. The creative process and the quality in the first few years really wasn&rsquo;t that great. When I look back at <em>Season One</em> I cringe (and that was the art I was &lsquo;happy&rsquo; with at the time). However if I didn&rsquo;t persevere, then I wouldn&rsquo;t be in the position I am now, where I am comfortable enough to draw the characters in a few short minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Schedule</strong>. This one is actually a self imposed reason. My thinking being that I cannot really predict how often I&rsquo;m likely to finish a drawing and do all the necessary post-production work. So instead the idea was to bank an entire season before I started publishing. The problem with this decision, is that nothing gets published (in my case over a year) and any momentum is lost.</li>
</ol>
<p>That is actually an issue that I would <em>like</em> to address. The simplest solution is to publish things as they become available and ignore the whole issue of <em>schedule</em>. As a companion to this solution I&rsquo;ve also decided to create small single image strip (created in my favourite notebooks of all time, the Midori MD A5 notebooks) that takes a few hours to draw and ink to provide stop gaps between more involved strips.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the first image.</p>
