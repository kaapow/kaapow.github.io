			"content_html": "<p><img src=\"http://micro.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/6986850d99.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n\n<p>On the weekend we drove up to the Shouf Biosphere Reserve. The only regret I have is that we didn‚Äôt even come close to experiencing the true majesty of the place.</p>\n\n<p>I‚Äôm writing these things down to make the most out of any future visits as the human brain will forget everything eventually.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"for-kids\">For Kids</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately I had shown Zane a picture of the ‚Äòsupposed‚Äô turtles that can be found in the reserve‚Ä¶as a complete lover of animals (I‚Äôm pretty sure he gets this from his mother), the poor little guy spent his entire time trying to find one while he was there. So top tip, don‚Äôt show pictures of animals.</p>\n\n<p>My baby boy Ryan loved being surrounded by trees. Like absolutely loved it in a way only a baby can feel excited about something new and natural and pure, because it‚Äôs the closest thing to him in that sense.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"graphics\">Graphics</h2>\n<p>I think the people behind the reserve have done a great job of the website and the overall information provided. The <a href=\"http://shoufcedar.org\">Shouf Cedar website</a> is probably one of the best site‚Äôs I‚Äôve seen in Lebanon. Sure it‚Äôs a WordPress affair, but it‚Äôs done in a tasteful manner. Make sure to take the time and run through all the information on the site to make the most out of your trip.</p>\n\n<p>I genuinely liked the logo for the whole reserve and really loved the tickets you buy at the entrance to the reserve.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://micro.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/f52372c95b.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"entrances\">Entrances</h2>\n<p>We ended up going through the Barouk entrance. While a lovely entrance, clearly not the main entrance, which is the Massar. However, there are no less than six entrances:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Maassar El Chouf</li>\n  <li>Barouk</li>\n  <li>Ain Zhlata/Bmohray</li>\n  <li>Mrosti</li>\n  <li>Niha</li>\n  <li>Aammiq</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Here‚Äôs a handy map, that if you squint hard enough you‚Äôll think is Lebanon, don‚Äôt be fooled (like I was the first time), that‚Äôs a map of the reserve itself. Once you get through the entrances, you have to travel around 5km into the reserve, park your car/bus and then you get to choose your hiking trail.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"eating\">Eating</h2>\n<p><em>Obviously</em> don‚Äôt expect to be able to eat anywhere in the reserve. I honestly didn‚Äôt consider this clearly. My suggestion is to basically either bring a good old honest picnic with you and eat at the entrance of the actual reserve (there are picnic benches) with a great view.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"signal\">Signal</h2>\n<p>Don‚Äôt expect any 3G/LTE signal while you‚Äôre up there. If you‚Äôre going to be dependant on technology to get you to places, make sure that it can work offline. The website lets you download GPS maps as well.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://micro.kaa.bz/uploads/2018/ab0aab89f5.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>While it‚Äôs easy to fall into the trap of thinking that you‚Äôre writing on your website for the ‚Äòinternet‚Äô, the truth of the matter is that you‚Äôre actually writing these things and obsessing about it‚Äôs design primarily and sometimes exclusively for yourself.</p>\n\n<p>These words are a snapshot in time. Of where you were and what you were doing. They might be reflections on what happened in your day or what‚Äôs currently captured your imagination.</p>\n\n<p>Why not just write this in a journal you say? Because ‚Äòpublishing‚Äô something on a site provides a level of finality. A level of accomplishment that a mere text file in a folder, or a journal entry in your notebook doesn‚Äôt provide. Not that there is anything wrong with either of those approaches, rather the online published version is <em>different</em>.</p>\n\n<p>One of my favourite new feature/plugins on <a href=\"http://micro.blog\">Micro.blog</a> is ability to <a href=\"https://github.com/cleverdevil/micromemories\">create an ‚Äòon-this-day‚Äô page</a> that collects your past posts that happened‚Ä¶.erm, on this day.</p>\n\n<p>The reason it‚Äôs so great is that it‚Äôs another clear tool, made for you. It‚Äôs made to allow you to reflect on what you‚Äôve written in the past and what you were thinking 1, 2, 3 or more years ago. If you‚Äôre not <em>using</em> this feature, then you‚Äôre missing out on one of the joys about blogging, which is reflecting on what you‚Äôve written.</p>\n",
