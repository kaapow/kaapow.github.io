The document he was probably referring to was <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/291023/scho0711buan-e-e.pdf\">this one here</a>, from the executive summary a very handy table is given:</p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Type of carrier</th>\n      <th>HDPE bag (No secondary reuse)</th>\n      <th>HDPE bag (40.3% reused as bin liners)</th>\n      <th>HDPE bag (100% reused as bin liners)</th>\n      <th>HDPE bag (Used 3 times)</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Paper bag</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>7</td>\n      <td>9</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>LDPE bag</td>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>9</td>\n      <td>12</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Non-woven PP bag</td>\n      <td>11</td>\n      <td>14</td>\n      <td>26</td>\n      <td>33</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Cotton bag</td>\n      <td>131</td>\n      <td>173</td>\n      <td>327</td>\n      <td>393</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>Sure, still a decent number of times that each type of bag needs to be reused, but a far cry from 20,000.
