			"content_html": "<p>📚 I <em>finally</em> finished a book this year, Michael Chabon’s <em>Manhood for Amateurs</em>. The book was written back in 2009 (which I believe is now being followed up with a sequel of sorts) and was the right book to read, as the words have resonated with me, as a newly minted father of a second son.</p>\n\n<p>I started it around the time my Ryan was born and it’s taken me 6 months to complete these 300 pages. I love to read, but <strong>clearly</strong> I don’t carve enough time to carry the action out. My reading has been pretty scattered across multiple books that I never seem to finish. I’m hoping this signals a return to a more regular reading pattern.</p>\n\n<p>What I also realised was that I’m not happy with how I’m reading. Or more accurately, the lack of taking notes or capturing the most interesting parts of books I read.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Here are some key quotes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Art is a form of exploration, of sailing off into the unknown alone, heading for those unmarked places on the map. If children are not permitted - not taught - to be adventurers and explorers as children, what will become of the world of adventure, of stories, of literature itself?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why else had they done it - built it all up so they could then knock it all down? After a marriage breaks, there is nothing more pointless than the child, to that child, of that marriage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The song has to take you by surprise, catch you when your guard is down, when you aren’t expecting it - ideally, when you aren’t even listening to the radio at all. A bright little piece of your life passes you by in a car with the windows rolled down, wells up in the pain-relief aisle of a Rite-Aid. That kind of chance encouter can’t happen as readily on an iPod you’ve programmed yourslf.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",
