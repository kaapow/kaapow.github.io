In my persuit to determine which iPhone I should be buying this year, it turns out I really donâ€™t need to get one after all.</p>\n\n<p>The reason for upgrading isnâ€™t because the phone is slow, lacks some essential feature or that certain apps donâ€™t run on it. Rather the <strong>only</strong> reason to upgrade is for the camera.</p>\n\n<p>Except I already own a pretty decent camera, the NEX-F3. I bought it just before Zane was born (so a little over 4 years ago now) and seem to have stopped using it 2 years ago. Why? Iâ€™m not sure. Maybe I bought into the whole â€˜the best camera is the one on youâ€™ ideaology?</p>\n\n<p>A quick read of a Wirecutter <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/first-sony-e-mount-lenses-to-buy/\">article I bookmarked in 2013</a>, led me to circling onto several Sigma lens that will help me get better photos. The bonus to all this is that theyâ€™re at a pretty reduced price point at the moment. And while weâ€™re here, we might as well talk about one of <a href=\"https://prolost.com/blog/2013/12/11/how-to-take-good-photos-for-under-1000.html\">my favourite article</a> about photography to brush up on some things.</p>\n",
